/*
 * HangCheck (0x8001ceb0, 0x4c4 bytes) — per-frame ledge-hang detector
 * (MOTION.C, called from ActCHASE/ActHANG/ActMOVE/HumanActionControl). Bails
 * immediately for a "type 0xA_" special character, or unless the player is
 * airborne with room below (map.height), not already recovering (motID !=
 * 0x901) and not mid-item-use (active_item != 0xB). Casts a short forward
 * probe (GetMoveSpeed) both ways from the character's feet: if the ground is
 * closer than the character's own Y (a wall/ledge edge underfoot), nudges
 * `*dtL` back away from it and bails. Otherwise probes further down (300,
 * then 400 units) for a ledge to catch: once a catchable ledge is found,
 * snaps `*dtL` onto it, and — unless already in the "hang" status (10) —
 * snaps the character's own facing (`dtR->vy`) to the nearest 90-degree
 * quadrant and re-validates the ledge is still there at the snapped facing
 * (bailing back to the pre-snap height if not); on success installs the
 * "hang" motion (0xa01), guarding against clobbering a motion mid-update on
 * another Humanoid the same way MotionAndMove.c does (CVAhuman[] scan),
 * plays the catch sound, and rumbles the pad if this is the player's own
 * Humanoid.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - GetAreaMapLevel's real prototype takes 5 args (area, x, y, z, mode) —
 *    Ghidra's own decompilation of this call under-counts to 3 (drops z and
 *    mode); m2c's raw a0-a3-plus-stack dump has the true arg list (cookbook:
 *    "m2c and Ghidra disagree on a call's ARG COUNT").
 *  - `Me_MOTION_C->width`/`vect.vx`/`vect.vz` are read `lhu` + a fused
 *    `sll 16/sra 17` (a per-TU divergent-width read of item.h's proven
 *    signed `width`/SVECTOR fields — cookbook: "Unsigned halfword loads
 *    mean the field is u16 even when a neighbouring field is s16") whenever
 *    the expression is `>> 1` (halved); plain additions of the SAME fields
 *    elsewhere in this function read them signed (`lh`) instead — two
 *    un-CSE'd loads of one value, same divergence class as
 *    DeleteConflict's `ConflictObjects`.
 *  - EVERY early bail is a guard clause (`return 0;`), NOT an `if (a && b &&
 *    c) { body } return 0;` wrapper: each `return 0` expands to its own
 *    [v0=0; j return_label] island and jump2's cross-jump merges them all
 *    into the LAST plain island — the oy-guard's inline `return 0` at
 *    0x8001d0d4 — which is where every earlier guard branches. The wrapper
 *    form instead emits the shared `move v0,zero` at the very END (after the
 *    return-1 tail), retargeting every guard branch and reshaping the tail.
 *  - The wall-path nudge is a CONDITIONAL body falling into a SHARED return:
 *    `if (dtL->vy < y) { nudge stores } return 0;` — the label between the
 *    stores and the [v0=0; j] island stops sched1 from hoisting the v0=0
 *    into the stores' load-delay holes (it is a separate basic block), so
 *    cross-jump later merges this island into the oy island, giving the
 *    target's `j .L8001D0D4` with the last `sw` in the delay slot. Spelled
 *    as `... if (y <= dtL->vy) return 0; stores; return 0;` the v0=0 shares
 *    the stores' block, sched1 (reverse list scheduler, priorities =
 *    depth-from-top, so a depth-1 constant-set always loses the bottom slot)
 *    buries it mid-block, cross-jump then can't match the tail, and the
 *    function runs one insn long with a knock-on register cascade.
 *  - By contrast the y3-failure revert (`{ dtL->vy = ...; return 0; }`
 *    INSIDE the if-arm, same basic block as its stores) is the shape whose
 *    v0=0 legitimately DOES get hoisted into the `lw` delay hole and whose
 *    `j` goes straight to the return label — both shapes appear in this one
 *    function, distinguished only by block boundaries.
 *  - The probe result is always the SAME reused `y` ($s0), including the
 *    committed 400-probe; the surviving ledge height is a separate `oy = y;`
 *    COPY made after the commit (the target's `move $s6,$s0` in the ry&0xFF
 *    guard's delay slot). gcc 2.8.1 never splits a live range, so the copy
 *    insn PROVES two pseudos: `y` is clobbered by the y3 re-probe while `oy`
 *    stays live for the revert. Assigning the probe straight into `oy`
 *    (no copy) runs one insn short.
 *  - `dy` is ONE variable assigned twice — `dy = yy - 300;` (the y2 probe's
 *    height arg) and later `dy = (dtL->vy - height) - 400;` (the y3/y4
 *    base) — which is why it colors into callee-saved $s1 even though the
 *    first segment crosses no call. The first assignment must sit BEFORE
 *    `if (y < dtL->vy)`: as the first statement of the ledge path it lands
 *    in the same basic block as its single use and combine folds it into
 *    the call arg (`addiu a2,s0,-300`), never materializing $s1. Placed
 *    before the branch it is cross-block, survives combine, and reorg pulls
 *    it into the wall-branch delay slot exactly like the target.
 *  - The facing snap masks into a TEMP then assigns back (`yc = ry & 0xC00;
 *    if (ry & 0x200) yc += 0x400; ry = yc;`) — target has the `move s2,v1`
 *    join copy and tests `ry & 0x200` against the UNmodified ry. Masking
 *    `ry` in place compiles two insns shorter.
 *  - fold-const association dictates the commit/revert spellings:
 *    `dtL->vy - (0x69 - y)` hits split_tree's CON-VAR case (varsign=-1,
 *    MINUS flips to PLUS) building PLUS(PLUS(vy,-105), y) → the target's
 *    `addiu vy,-105; addu +y` with vy first; the plain `dtL->vy - 0x69 + y`
 *    is reassociated to vy + (y-105), computing `y-105` as an independent
 *    insn that drifts into a delay slot. Likewise `dtL->vy - (oy - 5)`
 *    negates the const and refolds the inner term to PLUS(vy,5), giving
 *    `addiu vy,+5; subu -oy`; both `+ 5 - oy` and `- oy + 5` get mangled to
 *    vy - (oy-5).
 *  - The success-path commit writes vx, vz, THEN vy (`dtL->vx += vect.vx;
 *    dtL->vz += vect.vz; dtL->vy = dtL->vy - (0x69 - y);`): `vect`'s stack
 *    slot is address-taken so its `lh` reads can NEVER be disambiguated
 *    from the `*dtL` stores (sched adds a true dependence on every earlier
 *    store) — with vy stored second, `lh vect.vz` is pinned below the vy
 *    store and the block needs a hazard nop (one insn long); with vy last,
 *    the vz read precedes it in expand order and the scheduler interleaves
 *    the vy chain into the load-delay holes byte-exactly.
 *  - The SECOND feet-height (`(dtL->vy - height) - 400` into `dy`) genuinely
 *    recomputes because `dtL->vy` was modified by the intervening commit;
 *    the FIRST batch reuses the original `yy` (`yy - 400` inline, target's
 *    `addiu $a2,$s0,-0x190`). Both the target asm and m2c confirm the split.
 *  - `ry` is a SIGNED `long` (the read is `lh`, not `lhu`); the s16 copy
 *    `rys` passed to GetMoveSpeed is its own CSE'd narrowing ($s3).
 *  - `Me_MOTION_C->width >> 1` reads the field PLAIN: the fused `sll16/sra17`
 *    falls out of `>> 1` on the signed field; a `(u16)` cast compiles a
 *    wrong `srl`.
 *  - The CVAhuman scan is IDENTICAL to MotionAndMove.c's proven shape
 *    (`tag_CVAHumanEntry`, `short i`, provably-true `i=0` entry test folded
 *    away leaving a bottom-tested do/while-equivalent `for`) — reused
 *    verbatim here, except the "found" case must `goto` past the
 *    `SetNowMotion` call (shared with the "not found" fallthrough) rather
 *    than returning outright, since both paths still reach the `Sound` call.
 *  - `GlobalAreaMap` and `StagePlayer` are accessed via ABSOLUTE `lui/lw`
 *    (not `%gp_rel`) in this TU — left as plain externs, not added to the
 *    gp-extern list (only Me_MOTION_C/motID/dtL/dtR/MotionUpdateMode/
 *    D_80097F0E are gp-relative here, confirmed by `tools/gpsyms.py`).
