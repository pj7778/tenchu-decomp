/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 8 of 88 bytes differ (2 adjacent instructions,
 * "lui t0,0x8010" / "addiu a0,a0,6", swapped in order; same instructions,
 * same registers otherwise, 0 net length change).
 *
 * FUN_8005e8f0 (0x8005e8f0, 0x58 bytes) — stages a boot-exec record at the
 * fixed address 0x80100000 (Ghidra sees this as `MemoryPool[0x24000]`, but
 * a raw LITERAL pointer cast `(BootExecRecord *)0x80100000` is what
 * actually reproduces the shape — same distinction vinit.c's header
 * documents for its own literal `0x800DC000` store: Ghidra's "MemoryPool"
 * label is cosmetic, not proof of a real extern-symbol reference). Copies a
 * magic value, then copies a NUL-terminated name starting 6 bytes into
 * `arg0` (likely a CD directory entry, past its BCD position field) into
 * the record's name buffer, then stores two caller params (likely
 * load/exec addresses) past the name. Called by LoadExecEx.
 *
 * Matching notes (both required to reach the 8-byte residual from a
 * 25-vs-22-insn / 65-byte-diff starting point):
 *  - The base address MUST be a literal integer cast held in a named local
 *    pointer (`BootExecRecord *rec = (BootExecRecord *)0x80100000;`), not a
 *    declared `extern BootExecRecord D_80100000;` (which emits a full `la`
 *    per access — the cookbook's "extern-array symbol emits la" rule) and
 *    not an inline cast at each use site (three separate `lui`/`addiu`
 *    materializations instead of one shared `lui` reused via displacement
 *    for every field, cookbook's "named local pointer" table-chain rule).
 *    Because 0x80100000's low 16 bits are exactly 0, a bare `lui` alone is
 *    a fully valid pointer value, so cc1 can fold every field's constant
 *    offset (0/4/0x54/0x58) directly into each access's own displacement
 *    and reuse ONE register for the whole function — this only works for a
 *    compile-time-KNOWN literal base, not a relocatable symbol (whose low
 *    bits are unknown until link).
 *  - The mutating string cursor must REUSE the `arg0` parameter register
 *    directly (`arg0 = arg0 + 6; ... *arg0; arg0++;`), not a fresh named
 *    local — a fresh local swapped the cursor/index register ROLES
 *    (cursor ended up in the register the original gives to the index, and
 *    vice versa), a 16-byte residual on its own.
 *  - Residual: the base-pointer `lui` and the `arg0 = arg0 + 6` `addiu` are
 *    mutually independent (no data dependency), and the target schedules
 *    the `lui` FIRST while every C statement-order permutation tried here
 *    (both textual orders, split declaration/init, reordering the
 *    unrelated `i = 0` around them) scheduled the `addiu` first instead.
 *    `tools/autorules.py` found no local-rule win (int/s16/u32 width
 *    sweep). `tools/regalloc.py` shows no calls and no copy-chains in this
 *    function at all — confirming it's a pure sched1 tie between two
 *    independent single-cycle ops, not a register-allocation question. A
 *    bounded ~6-minute `tools/permute.py --stop-on-zero` run found nothing
 *    (timed out, flat). Matches the cookbook's "sub-C-level residual
 *    early-stop" class (adjacent-instruction reorder, same instructions/
 *    registers) — permuter-immune by the documented pattern, parked here
 *    rather than burning further budget.
