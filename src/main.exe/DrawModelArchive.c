 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * DrawModelArchive (0x8001768c) — MATCHED.
 *
 * Same TU as DrawModel.c/DrawSprite.c (3DCTRL.C): the ModelArchiveType twin
 * of DrawModel's visibility gauntlet (same GsGetLs+GsSetLsMatrix /
 * attribute&1/2/4/8/0x10 clip test / UnitVector RotTransPers), gated by a
 * SkipFrame early-out and a `gap<0` bypass, and instead of a single DrawTMD
 * call it walks `mad->object[0..n)` drawing each visible (attribute&1==0)
 * sub-model with `gap` as the DrawTMD mode.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `sz`/`result` follow DrawSprite's two-variable shape: `sz` ($v1) holds
 *    the OTZ from either RotTransPers (re-tested by the attribute&4/&0x10
 *    guards), `result` ($v0) is the "-1 = reject / else the accepted OTZ"
 *    value the tail sums with `gap` — assigned only at each exit edge, never
 *    once up front, so cc1 rematerialises `li v0,-1` per reject.
 *  - There is exactly ONE shared `reject:` block. Every reject site reaches
 *    it with `goto reject;` — including attribute&1, exactly as the matched
 *    sibling DrawSprite spells it. The asm LOOKS like four independent
 *    "direct to tail" rejects (`bcond tail` + own `li v0,-1` in the delay
 *    slot) plus one branch to a shared stub, but that is reorg's doing, not
 *    the source's: reorg steals reject's own `li v0,-1` into each eligible
 *    branch's delay slot and retargets the branch THROUGH reject's `j tail`
 *    to tail itself. The iv2>=0xb5 site (0x8001775c) still points at the real
 *    `reject:` only because its delay slot was already taken by
 *    `andi v0,s0,0x10`, so reorg had nothing to steal with. The five
 *    `li v0,-1` in the target are one real + four stolen copies.
 *    Do NOT spell any reject as its own `result = -1; goto tail;` body: a
 *    trailing `result=-1` block adjacent to `tail:` gets a free fallthrough,
 *    which is an identical instruction stream to reject's `li v0,-1; j tail`,
 *    so it absorbs reject and swaps reject with the DrawTMDmode==0 arm
 *    (44 bytes).
 *  - `if (SkipFrame == 1) goto ret1;` must be a GOTO to the function's single
 *    trailing `return 1;`, not an inline `return 1;`. An inline early return
 *    leaves a join CODE_LABEL (RTL `code_label 25`) between the `mad`
 *    parameter copy and the first `GsGetLs` call. cse's basic block ends at
 *    every CODE_LABEL, so the a0 == mad equivalence dies there and cc1 emits
 *    a redundant `move a0,s2`, which reorg then hoists into the `bltz s3`
 *    delay slot the target leaves as a bare `nop`. Spelled as a goto, the
 *    body is a lone jump, so jump.c folds the guard and deletes the label
 *    (exactly as it already folds `if (gap < 0) goto loop;`); cse's block
 *    then spans the prologue through the call and deletes the copy, leaving
 *    a0 holding the incoming `mad`. The `nop` is the SYMPTOM — with the copy
 *    gone the fallthrough block starts with the `jal`, which is ineligible
 *    for a delay slot. Verified with `tools/rtldump.py --pass rtl,jump,cse`.
 *  - `RotTransPers(&UnitVector, ...)` passes a literal NULL sxy pointer here
 *    (no sprite-relative xy to fill, unlike DrawSprite's `xy`), so there is
 *    no `if (xy != 0)` tail arm — `result = sz;` sits directly after the
 *    DrawTMDmode if/else and is the last block before `tail:`.
 *  - The tail test is `result + gap`, not `result == -1`: DrawModelArchive
 *    folds the caller's `gap` into the same sentinel arithmetic.
 *  - The sub-model loop is a plain `for (i = 0; i < mad->n; i++)` over
 *    `mad->object[i]`; cc1's own loop rotation duplicates the `0 < mad->n`
 *    entry test for free. `i` is `short`: the per-iteration address is
 *    recomputed via the fused `sll 16/sra 14` sign-extend+scale (the
 *    short-counter idiom that suppresses loop.c's strength reduction).
