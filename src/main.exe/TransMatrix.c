/*
 * TransMatrix (0x80078354, 36 bytes) — stock PsyQ libgte (Ghidra places it in
 * MTX_07.OBJ): set a MATRIX's translation vector from a VECTOR, return the
 * matrix. `t` is at offset 20, after the 3x3 short rotation block.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING at 23/36 — and the evidence says this is a HANDWRITTEN-ASM
 * original, not a tie. FLAGGED FOR OWNER DECISION: it is not yet in
 * config/handwritten-asm.txt, and adding it is an owner call (that list is an
 * owner decision, docs/gte-policy.md). Two independent cc1-invariant tells, both
 * measured here, not argued:
 *
 * TARGET                       OURS (the 3-temp draft below)
 *   lw   t0,0(a1)                lw   v1,0(a1)
 *   lw   t1,4(a1)                lw   a0,4(a1)
 *   lw   t2,8(a1)                lw   a1,8(a1)
 *   sw   t0,20(a0)               sw   v1,20(v0)
 *   sw   t1,24(a0)               sw   a0,24(v0)
 *   sw   t2,28(a0)               sw   a1,28(v0)
 *   move v0,a0                   jr   ra
 *   jr   ra                      sw   a1,28(v0)   <- slot FILLED
 *   nop                        (8 insns / 32 bytes vs the target's 9 / 36)
 *
 * 1. REGISTER CHOICE. The draft reproduces the target's SHAPE exactly — three
 *    loads held live, then three stores, which is the "N adjacent loads are
 *    source temps" rule working. But cc1 colours them v1(3), a0(4), a1(5): the
 *    numerically lowest free registers, reusing the two parameter registers the
 *    moment they die. The target uses t0(8), t1(9), t2(10), stepping over four
 *    lower registers. config/mips/mips.h defines no REG_ALLOC_ORDER (0 hits), and
 *    BOTH allocators then walk the hard registers NUMERICALLY — verified in the
 *    pinned source, not recalled (`tools/ccsrc.py --grep REG_ALLOC_ORDER
 *    --context 4`): global.c:960 and local-alloc.c:2266 carry the identical
 *    `#ifdef REG_ALLOC_ORDER / regno = reg_alloc_order[i]; #else / regno = i;`.
 *    So it does not matter whether these temps are coloured by local_alloc or
 *    global_alloc: there is no allocation this compiler performs that lands on
 *    t0/t1/t2 while v1/a0/a1 sit free.
 * 2. AN UNFILLED DELAY SLOT WITH AN OBVIOUS FILLER. The target ends
 *    `move v0,a0 / jr ra / nop`. `move v0,a0` is independent of the jump and sits
 *    directly above it; reorg fills that slot every time — our build does exactly
 *    that, which is the whole 4-byte length difference. No C makes cc1 decline.
 *
 * COMPILER-PROVENANCE CHALLENGE (2026-07-19). The natural three-temp body was
 * compiled with every locally available Sony/MIPS backend: GCC 2.6.3, 2.7.2,
 * 2.8.0, 2.8.1, 2.91.66 and 2.95.2, plus the narrowly patched 2.8.1 backend that
 * reproduces GS_107.OBJ's block-move delay slot. The first four and the patched
 * backend all emit the same v1/a0/a1 homes shown above; the two newer compilers
 * use v1/a2/a3. Every optimized backend fills the final store into `jr ra`, and
 * none uses t0/t1/t2. With 2.8.1, -O1 and -O2 agree; -O0 instead spills the
 * arguments and all three locals to a frame. The even more obvious direct-field
 * spelling (`m->t[0] = v->vx;` etc.) interleaves each load with its store. Thus
 * neither a stock SDK compiler revision, optimization level, the GS_107 backend
 * quirk, nor the two ordinary human spellings explains the target.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THIS CLAIM — read this before citing the file. The two tells above are
 * measured and they are about THIS FUNCTION. They do NOT establish a class. It is
 * tempting to say "PsyQ's libgte primitives were hand-written assembly, so the
 * SDK's matrix code is all asm" — that is a plausible story with ONE data point
 * behind it, and generalising a mechanism from one function's bytes is exactly how
 * the argmove "park on sight" rule became false and told lanes to abandon
 * reachable functions (see the cookbook's §4). Counter-evidence already exists:
 * GsSetLsMatrix, a real libgs entry, MATCHED from C on the first build.
 *
 * So: parked, not classified. NOT added to config/handwritten-asm.txt — that list
 * is an owner decision and each entry silently removes a function from the board
 * forever, which is a false-park risk at scale. Owner directive (2026-07-17):
 * park the clearly-asm-looking ones, do not conclude the class without real data,
 * and prefer likely-not-asm targets until we run out.
 *
 * If the class question is ever worth settling, settle it with a SURVEY, not a
 * story: apply both tells mechanically across the SDK (a numeric-walk violation is
 * decidable from the disassembly plus the free-register set; an unfilled delay slot
 * with an independent producer directly above it is decidable too) and count. That
 * is data. One function is an anecdote.
