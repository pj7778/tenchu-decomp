 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * GetScreenPositionS (0x80039610, 0x74 bytes) — camera-relative coordinate
 * transform helper: writes (x,y,z) - ViewInfo.(vpx,vpy,vpz) as a scratchpad
 * SVECTOR (fixed PS1 scratchpad RAM at 0x1F800000 — same region
 * PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c's MATRIX uses, Ghidra names it "Scratchpad"), then calls
 * RotTransPers (a GTE perspective-transform library wrapper, 0x80078704 >
 * 0x80060000, precompiled — only this call site's argument setup is
 * source-shaped) with that SVECTOR, the caller's own output pointer arg3
 * (passed through unmodified — RotTransPers presumably writes screen xy
 * into it internally), and two more scratchpad slots
 * (Scratchpad+0/Scratchpad+0x10). RotTransPers's returned OTZ (depth) gets
 * written to arg3's second word (`arg3[1]`, i.e. +4 bytes).
 *
 * ViewInfo.vpx/vpy/vpz are canonical GsRVIEW2 `long` fields (s32 on PsyQ,
 * matching Ghidra's independently-built GsRVIEW2 — see ReqItemDefault.c).
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `arg0 - (short)ViewInfo.vpx` is a NARROWING use (the result stores
 *    into a scratchpad s16 field) of a s32 global's LOW HALF — cc1 emits
 *    `lhu` for it (the same "sign bits are provably dead" rule as
 *    DeleteConflict's ConflictObjects, just with an extra explicit
 *    narrowing cast on top; the outer store's truncation is what licenses
 *    it, not the cast alone).
 *  - Raw scratchpad addresses are plain integer-literal pointer casts
 *    (`(SVECTOR *)0x1F800080`), never a shared "Scratchpad + offset"
 *    symbol — matches PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c's `(MATRIX *)0x1F800000` precedent.
 *    A raw-constant cast materializes via `lui`+`ori` (not `addiu`): the
 *    `li` macro treats it as an unsigned bit pattern, unlike a relocatable
 *    symbol's `%lo()` (always `addiu`).
