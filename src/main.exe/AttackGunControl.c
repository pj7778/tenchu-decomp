 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * AttackGunControl (0x800274e8, 0x6c bytes) - an animation-frame callback (this
 * TU's dtM/Me_MOTION_C family, see handle_char_state_attacking_SEVEN_.c /
 * AttackFire.c, the real near-twins - not leRestoreEnemyLayout, which was
 * just an assembly-shape false positive): fires only when the currently-armed
 * motion trigger (dtM->count) matches the caller's frame id, then spawns a
 * projectile via bow_shoot_logic (kind 0x14 - not the 0x15 arrow case) from
 * the wielded weapon's tip (Me_MOTION_C->model->object[0xd], same item-TU
 * Humanoid/ModelArchiveType as the siblings) and plays a sound.
 *
 * The recovered name is backed by the demo's two-short `length, frm`
 * prototype and PARAM_ITEM_LAUNCH local, plus the retail gun request kind and
 * weapon-object-0xd role. It is not a positional-only PSX.SYM transplant.
 *
 * `dtM` kept as the same minimal 2-field stand-in as its siblings (only the
 * offset-2 `count` field is proven; Ghidra's own field name is an unverified
 * guess - see the cookbook's "zero other usages -> it's a guess" rule).
 *
 * Matching notes: the frame was 40 bytes (exactly sizeof(PARAM_ITEM_USE))
 * short until adding an UNUSED local `PARAM_ITEM_USE p;` - never read or
 * written, just declared. cc1 reserves stack space for every declared
 * automatic aggregate regardless of use, so a dead local of the sibling
 * functions' own PARAM_ITEM_USE size reproduces the target's frame exactly;
 * plausible as leftover from refactoring this callback (which used to build
 * the item params inline like AttackFire.c/handle_char_state_attacking_
 * SEVEN_.c do) into a thin bow_shoot_logic(kind, pos) wrapper.
