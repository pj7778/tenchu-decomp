/*
 * GetMoveSpeed (0x80029660, 0xcc bytes) — same "Humanoid control" TU as
 * MoveHumanoid.c/GetHumanoid.c (HUMAN.C). Fills *vect with the (vx,vz)
 * velocity for a given facing angle `ry` and an (ordr,side) speed pair —
 * MoveHumanoid computes the same rotation from human->rotate->vy instead of
 * a plain parameter; this looks like its shared helper.
 *
 * Matching notes (see MoveHumanoid's identical idioms):
 *  - `s = -rsin(...); c = -rcos(...);` negates AT THE ASSIGNMENT — reorg
 *    steals the first negate into the second call's delay slot (the
 *    "x = -f(...)" rule), so -sin is live across the rcos call.
 *  - `(short)s`/`(short)c` casts are written INLINE at each of their two
 *    uses in the vx/vz expressions; cc1 CSEs the repeated cast into a
 *    single truncation per variable (no re-truncation on reuse).
 *  - `ordr`/`side` are the plain `short` parameters (no MoveHumanoid-style
 *    io/o resign locals — this function does no -0x100 byte-resign), so
 *    their (int) promotion is deferred to each expression's first use.
