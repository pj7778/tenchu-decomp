 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * STATUS: MATCHING — pure C, all 664 bytes / 166 instructions exact.  The
 * 0x30 frame and s0-s5+ra save set are exact as well.
 *
 * A jump2-erased identical-arm alias separates the long-lived output base
 * (`fly`) from the incoming `pfly` formal.  Unlike the old all-in-one inline
 * helper, the direct vector copies leave `start` and `end` in a1/a2 until the
 * distance call; retail's late argument moves can therefore fill the end-copy
 * load delay slots.  The alias itself takes the target's s2 throughout.
 *
 * The scaled-X product has its own caller-saved identity, while `len` is
 * reused for the scaled-Y product and then for both the X and Y branch
 * results.  Keeping the asymmetric Y range separate from scaled `yh` gives
 * retail's s0 range and s5 magnitude simultaneously.  Assigning the final X
 * and Z coordinates inside both jitter arms retains the target's duplicated
 * arithmetic tails; `SubFlyJitter` does the same for Y.
 *
 * Two nested one-shot loops enclose the X midpoint and range assignments.
 * They leave no machine branch, but their loop notes give the midpoint the
 * target allocation priority and let the range shift schedule between the
 * two midpoint loads.  No asm, register pinning, volatile access, or
 * undefined-value fence is used.
 *
 * Everything structural is reproduced: the 6-arg prototype, mode/speed byte
 * stores, the `dist/time` speed clamp through the byte's own `& 0xff`
 * truncation, the pre-shifted hy and hy/2 asymmetric split, the X/Y/Z jitter
 * polarity, and `--expand-div` for the variable divisions.
 *
 * Matching notes (all verified against the original bytes):
 *  - SetupFly's true arity is 6, not Ghidra's 4: the already-matched callers
 *    (ReqItemArrow, ReqItemHappou, ReqItemLaunch) all declare and call it
 *    `void SetupFly(void *param, VECTOR *start, VECTOR *end, s32 a4, s32 a5,
 *    s32 a6)` — Ghidra drops `yh`/`time`, the two STACK-passed args past the
 *    four register ones (cookbook: Ghidra undercounts stack args). Kept the
 *    first parameter `long *pfly` here (matching Ghidra's own indexing
 *    style) rather than inventing `struct param_fly *` — nothing in this
 *    function needs the union's other members, and the three callers' own
 *    externs already keep it `void *` (respell per-TU; don't fight it).
 *  - `pfly->mode` (byte @0x28) is set to 0 as the FIRST statement, before
 *    start/end are even copied in — matches Ghidra's own rendering exactly.
 *  - The "speed" byte (@0x24, `dist / time`, a genuine variable division —
 *    needs `--expand-div`) is clamped to at least 1 when the division
 *    truncates to zero, using the BYTE value's own truncation as the test
 *    (`if ((speed & 0xff) != 0) goto skip_default;`), not a fresh compare of
 *    the untruncated quotient. It's copied to the adjacent byte (@0x25)
 *    later, interleaved with the X-magnitude scaling (read back through the
 *    pointer both times — no cached local survives that span, matching the
 *    fresh `lbu` reloads in the asm), and decremented once, last, right
 *    before return.
 *  - The X/Y/Z "current point" fields (@0x18/0x1c/0x20) share one shape —
 *    `if (range > 0) mid + (rand() % range OP half) else mid OP half` — but
 *    X and Z use a SYMMETRIC range (`2 * hx`, offset `hx`) while Y instead
 *    splits `half = hy / 2; other = hy - half;` and divides by `other`
 *    (the SAME asymmetric split as SetBlood's time jitter) — verified from
 *    the raw asm, not assumed by symmetry with X/Z. X ADDS its jitter, Y
 *    SUBTRACTS, Z ADDS again.
 *  - X and Z reuse the SAME magnitude `hx` (the yw-derived one, not a
 *    separate z-magnitude) for their own jitter range — confirmed by the
 *    raw asm recomputing `2 * hx` fresh at each site (not CSE'd across the
 *    distance), so both are written as the literal expression `hx * 2`
 *    rather than a shared named temp.
