 * Original parameters and locals (the demo build's register allocation may
 * differ from retail, but the COUNT and TYPES drive cc1's codegen and carry
 * over). A repeated name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     param $s1       struct GsIMAGE * image
 *     param $s0       struct POLY_GT4 * ply
 *     param $a2       short x

/*
 * SetupImageToPolyGT4 (0x8004ec10, 0x144 bytes) — the Gouraud twin of
 * SetupImageToPolyFT4 (IMAGES.C), byte-for-byte the same shape: the only
 * difference is POLY_GT4's per-vertex colour, so all twelve r/g/b bytes are
 * written 0x7F instead of FT4's three. Layout below is PSX.SYM's own POLY_GT4
 * (reference/psxsym-types.h), which confirms every offset in the .s.
 *
 * PSX.SYM's local list for this function (tx/ty/th) is from the DEMO build —
 * retail's version was rewritten to match FT4's shape, so the FT4 locals are
 * what reproduce the bytes here.
