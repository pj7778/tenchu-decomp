 * FUN_800566fc (0x800566fc, 0xa0 bytes) — same PersistentState-at-0x80010000
 * family as FUN_800566c0.c/FUN_800565f0.c (game_types.h's PersistentState;
 * see FUN_800566c0.c for the `#define PSTATE` convention and the proven
 * backup@0x27/stock@0x40C/chr@0x4 offsets). This is FUN_800566c0's mirror
 * image: restores this character's shop stock row FROM the loadout backup
 * (`PSTATE->stock[i + PSTATE->chr*0x20] = PSTATE->backup[i];`), then fades
 * out, tears down (FUN_80038ce0), resets the stage layout number to 0xFF
 * and clears PersistentState's bit-0 "item screen already initialised" flag
 * (flags48 &= ~1), and calls FUN_8004f6c0(0x10) (a cleanup/teardown helper
 * — see its own file).
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - Ghidra's `FadeOutDirect(0x20,2,'\b','\b')` undercounts the call: the
 *    raw asm passes a FIFTH argument on the stack (`sw v0,0x10(sp)` in the
 *    jal's delay slot, v0==8 same as the two register args) — confirmed by
 *    BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen.c's identical, already-matched
 *    `FadeOutDirect(0x20, 2, 8, 8, 8);` call (proto `s16,s16,u8,u8,u8`).
 *  - The loop index is `s16 i` (Ghidra's `iVar2`, shown as `int` but the
 *    raw asm's own per-iteration `sll/sra` pairs on BOTH the pre- and
 *    post-increment values only reproduce with a genuinely narrow
 *    counter) narrowed again into a SEPARATE `short idx` (Ghidra's
 *    `sVar1`) each iteration — one variable for both roles doesn't
 *    reproduce both narrows.
 *  - **Statement order inside the loop is load-bearing and reversed from
 *    Ghidra's own rendering**: the STORE must come BEFORE `i = i + 1;`
 *    (`idx = (s16)i; PSTATE->stock[...] = PSTATE->backup[idx]; i = i +
 *    1;`), even though Ghidra shows the increment first. Writing the
 *    increment first (Ghidra's literal order) compiles to an
 *    instruction-for-instruction-identical function with every register
 *    past the first few shifted by one slot — found via
 *    `tools/permute.py` (score 730->40 in one run), then verified by hand
 *    against a plain byte diff (autorules'/permute's own internal scores
 *    are a DIFFERENT metric than raw bytes — always confirm a permuter
 *    or autorules "win" with `tools/matchdiff.py`, not just its own
 *    reported score, which side-tracked this exact residual once).
