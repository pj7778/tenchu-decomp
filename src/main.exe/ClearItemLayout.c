 * ClearItemLayout (0x8004a500) — debug menu "clear item layout" action
 * (DoInfoViewProc's ItemLayoutMenu, case 1, after the "clear ok?" confirm
 * comes back true). Force-disposes every live slot in the item pool: for
 * each of the 30 slots with proc != 0, run its proc with mode=0xff, delete
 * the conflict, complain if mode didn't clear, then clear owner/proc — the
 * identical dispose sequence as ReqItemDrop/ProcItemManebue/FUN_8004a42c.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - A hand-rolled `label: ...; goto label;` loop, NOT a `for`/`while`: the
 *    target keeps ONE cursor register (`it`) with plain field offsets and
 *    never hoists the loop-invariant D_800121CC address or the 0xff
 *    constant out of the loop. A real for/while(1) here gets recognized by
 *    loop.c, which both strength-reduces `it->proc`'s repeated offset into a
 *    SECOND derived pointer (a giv alongside `it` itself) and hoists the
 *    invariants to a preheader — neither happens in the target, so no loop
 *    notes were ever emitted (front end never sees a real loop construct).
