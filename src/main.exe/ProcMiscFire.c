 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * STATUS: MATCHING — 356 bytes. Declaring the constant as an unknown-bound
 * `SVECTOR` array and copying element zero makes cc1 materialize its address
 * as the target's `lui v0,%hi` / `addiu t3,v0,%lo` register handoff.
 *
 * ProcMiscFire (0x8004d570, 0x164 bytes) — MISC_FIRE's ProcMisc* handler:
 * MM_CREATE arms a 10-tick fuse; every later message decrements it (once
 * per call, gated on `mode == 0`) and, when it reaches 0, detonates: an
 * explosion + a burning-embers burst + a smoke puff at m's position, then
 * rearms the fuse to a random 0..149 tick count and plays the bang sound.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `msg > MM_RESUME` is the same unsigned-enum dispatch as ProcMiscSprite
 *    (`enum TMiscMessage msg`, not plain `s32`, is what gets cc1 to emit
 *    `sltiu` instead of `slti`).
 *  - `--m->count` (or equivalently `m->count = m->count - 1;`) stores
 *    unconditionally in the branch's delay slot even on the "still armed"
 *    path — ordinary statement order, no special shape needed.
 *  - `vec = D_80097C48;` is a whole-SVECTOR struct assignment (align-2
 *    `lwl/lwr`+`swl/swr` block move, cookbook: cast type's alignment drives
 *    copy code) from an unnamed 8-byte rodata/data constant — NOT the
 *    Ghidra-rendered `local_28._4_4_ = (uint)(ushort)local_28.pad << 0x10;`
 *    later in the function, which is a decompiler artifact: the raw .s has
 *    three plain adjacent `sh` stores (vx=0, vy=-200, vz=0), no pad touched
 *    at all (cookbook: trust the assembly over Ghidra's rendering).
 *  - `m->count = rand() % 150;` keeps the call inline so the magic-multiply
 *    divide operates directly on $v0.
