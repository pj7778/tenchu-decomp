 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 10 of 356 bytes differ. Residual is the named
 * permuter-immune "la reload tie" (cookbook, Iteration protocol): the
 * address of the unnamed SVECTOR constant `D_80097C48` builds as
 * `lui v0,%hi / addiu t3,v0,%lo` (two registers) in the target, with an
 * unrelated independent instruction (`addiu s1,sp,24`, materializing
 * `&pos`, sp+0x18 per PSX.SYM) scheduled between the two halves; our build
 * instead puts both halves in ONE register (`lui t3,%hi / addiu t3,t3,%lo`)
 * with the independent instruction moved before instead of between.
 * Tried and reverted: swapping the `vec`/`pos` local declaration order
 * (worse, 40 bytes) and swapping the `vec = D_80097C48;` /
 * `pos.v{x,y,z} = m->{x,y,z};` statement order (worse, 22 bytes — reorders
 * the visible store sequence too). RE-CONFIRMED this session: `rtldump
 * --pass all` shows the constant's address is a single-block SImode pseudo
 * (defined and consumed with no intervening branch — NOT the documented
 * "block-crossing pseudo" pattern that `local-alloc.c`'s `combine_regs`
 * fix cracked for FileRead/PrepareAccess/AfsOpen, so that fix doesn't
 * apply here), and a bounded permuter run (240s, `-j4 --stop-on-zero`,
 * 27390 iterations) never beat the base score of 205 — confirms genuinely
 * flat, not under-searched. Per the cookbook, this exact tie class
 * (PrepareAccess, cd_open) has never been cracked by the permuter or by
 * source-shaping; parked as a confirmed member of it.
 *
 * ProcMiscFire (0x8004d570, 0x164 bytes) — MISC_FIRE's ProcMisc* handler:
 * MM_CREATE arms a 10-tick fuse; every later message decrements it (once
 * per call, gated on `mode == 0`) and, when it reaches 0, detonates: an
 * explosion + a burning-embers burst + a smoke puff at m's position, then
 * rearms the fuse to a random 0..149 tick count and plays the bang sound.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `msg > MM_RESUME` is the same unsigned-enum dispatch as ProcMiscSprite
 *    (`enum TMiscMessage msg`, not plain `s32`, is what gets cc1 to emit
 *    `sltiu` instead of `slti`).
 *  - `--m->count` (or equivalently `m->count = m->count - 1;`) stores
 *    unconditionally in the branch's delay slot even on the "still armed"
 *    path — ordinary statement order, no special shape needed.
 *  - `vec = D_80097C48;` is a whole-SVECTOR struct assignment (align-2
 *    `lwl/lwr`+`swl/swr` block move, cookbook: cast type's alignment drives
 *    copy code) from an unnamed 8-byte rodata/data constant — NOT the
 *    Ghidra-rendered `local_28._4_4_ = (uint)(ushort)local_28.pad << 0x10;`
 *    later in the function, which is a decompiler artifact: the raw .s has
 *    three plain adjacent `sh` stores (vx=0, vy=-200, vz=0), no pad touched
 *    at all (cookbook: trust the assembly over Ghidra's rendering).
 *  - `m->count = rand() % 150;` keeps the call inline so the magic-multiply
 *    divide operates directly on $v0.
