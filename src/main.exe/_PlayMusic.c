/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 340 of 400 bytes differ (6 whole instructions /
 * 24 bytes too long; every downstream byte is address drift from that gap,
 * not a separate issue — see residual below).
 *
 * _PlayMusic (0x8004ed54, 0x190 bytes) — dispatches a music-play request:
 * MusicNo in [0x3D, 0x63] (checked UNSIGNED, `MusicNo-0x3D < 0x27`) or
 * negative is an error (message box + stop CD audio); MusicNo < 0x13 plays
 * a CD-XA track from `MusicTable[MusicNo]`; otherwise it's a synthesized
 * "voice" cue played via `PlayVoice(MusicNo + 0x52)` (`+0x64` instead once
 * MusicNo > 99, so the id space doesn't collide past two digits).
 *
 * Splat/Ghidra split this one function into 3 pieces
 * (`_PlayMusic`/`play_stage_music__override__prt_8004ed94_...`/
 * `..._prt_8004edf4_...`) — they're contiguous addresses with plain
 * fallthrough between them (no jump table), just Ghidra mis-identifying
 * internal control-flow joins as separate functions; one real C function
 * reproduces all three.
 *
 * `MusicTable`'s real stride is 12 bytes, not PSX.SYM's stale 8-byte
 * `TMusicTable` (file@0, channel@4, min@5, sec@6) — the asm also reads
 * offsets 7/8 (the `end` CdlLOC's min/sec) and scales the index by 12
 * (`MusicNo*3<<2`), so the true struct has two more `u8` fields.
 *
 * The 3 embedded strings ("bad music no", the sprintf format, "playmusic
 * fail...") show as bare hex in the .s (no `%hi(SYMBOL)`) only because
 * splat never carved/named that unreferenced rodata — NOT because the
 * source used a literal pointer cast: writing them as literal casts
 * (`(char *)0x8001349C`) compiles the low half with `ori` (raw 32-bit
 * constant synthesis); the target's `addiu` (address-style combine)
 * needs a real named `extern char D_8001349C[];` (config/symbols.main.exe.txt
 * entries added), confirmed empirically. Contrast FUN_800568b8.c's
 * `(PersistentState *)0x80010000` cast, which really is a bare literal
 * (that lui has NO addiu at all, reused as a base for several field
 * offsets) — a different, narrower tell than "no %hi(SYMBOL) shown here".
 *
 * `MusicTable[MusicNo]`'s two `CdlLOC` locals (`start`/`end`) are declared
 * `CdlLOC[2]` (matching Ghidra's own `local_28[2]`/`local_20[2]` rendering
 * over PSX.SYM's singular `struct CdlLOC start`) and passed as the bare
 * array (decaying to `CdlLOC *`) to `CdPosToInt`/`CdIntToPos`/`CdaPlayXA` —
 * PSX.SYM's local TYPE (not count) is the "wrong in ~2 of 5" case here.
 *
 * `D_8001005A` is FUN_8004f68c.c's already-proven persisted volume byte
 * (passed to `FUN_8004fbf4` twice, identically, exactly as that file
 * does).
 *
 * The MusicNo<100-vs->=100 id offset (`+0x52`/`+0x64`) is a plain
 * default-then-override scalar (no address involved), so the literal
 * Ghidra shape (`id = MusicNo+0x52; if (MusicNo>99) id = MusicNo+0x64;`)
 * is safe here — the cookbook's default-then-override CAVEAT is
 * specifically about a shared ADDRESS pseudo stationary across a later
 * access to the same lvalue, not a plain scalar with no further reference.
 *
 * Residual (root-caused): `start`/`end`'s stack address (`sp+224`/`sp+232`)
 * is referenced across 3-4 calls each (memset, the two field stores,
 * CdPosToInt, CdIntToPos); this draft's cc1 caches each address in its own
 * callee-saved register ($s0/$s1) since it's live across those calls,
 * pushing MusicNo/mode from the target's $s3/$s4 to $s5/$s6 and growing
 * the frame by 8 bytes (2 more saved registers) — 6 extra instructions
 * total. The target instead REMATERIALIZES `addiu $rN,$sp,22{4,8}` fresh
 * at every use (a stack-frame offset is exactly as cheap to recompute as
 * to keep live), needing no dedicated register at all. Tried and had no
 * effect on the choice: `CdlLOC[2]` vs a bare single struct, `&arr[0].
 * minute` vs bare `arr` spelling for memset's argument, and inlining
 * `CdIntToPos(CdPosToInt(start)*2+0x96, start)` instead of a named `n`
 * temp (to lower overall register pressure). This looks like a genuine
 * cc1 cost-model tie for a repeatedly-referenced stack address rather
 * than something reachable from source spelling.
