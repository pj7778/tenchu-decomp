/*
 * SetupImageToPolyFT4 (0x8004eaf0, 0x120 bytes) — POLY_FT4 analogue of
 * InitSprite.c: builds a textured GPU quad primitive from the SAME GsIMAGE
 * source struct InitSprite reads (identical field offsets: pmode-narrow-cast
 * @0, px/py signed @4/6, pw/ph unsigned @8/A, cx/cy signed @0x10/0x12 — same
 * "narrow lhu view of pmode" and "byte-narrowed py" idioms), placing four
 * (x,y)/(u,v) vertices offset by the scaled pw/ph instead of one x/y/scale
 * triple. POLY_FT4 (u0/v0/clut/x1/y1/u1/v1/tpage/x2/y2/u2/v2/pad1/x3/y3/u3/
 * v3/pad2) is the real PsyQ SDK layout (reference/ghidra_types.h), declared
 * locally per the SetPolyXF4.c precedent (no shared header owns it yet).
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `image->px`/`image->py`/`image->pw`/`image->ph` are read into NAMED
 *    TEMPS right after `sh` is computed, ALL FOUR BEFORE the r0/g0/b0/x0/
 *    y0/y1/x2 stores — Ghidra's own decompilation shows this same grouping
 *    (uVar1/uVar8/uVar2/uVar3 assigned before the stores); inlining the
 *    field reads at their later use sites instead reorders the schedule
 *    (loads no longer hoist ahead of the stores) and mis-colors 3
 *    registers even though the instruction COUNT stays identical — a
 *    "N adjacent loads with no use between them are source temps" case.
 *  - `image->py`'s BYTE-narrowed read ((u8) cast, `lbu`) is a distinct
 *    load from the earlier full `lh` read for the GetTPage argument —
 *    different machine modes don't CSE (DeleteConflict's ConflictObjects).
 *  - u0/u1 byte values are each stored to TWO fields (u0Val to u0 and u2;
 *    u1Val to u1 and u3) and the py-derived byte to v0/v1 then v2Val to
 *    v2/v3 — named locals for exactly the values reused across those
 *    non-adjacent stores, matching Ghidra's own bVar4/uVar6/uVar8 temps.
 *  - `u0Val`/`u1Val` must stay UNCAST/WIDE (u32/u16, no `(u8)` truncation
 *    on the assignment): an explicit `(u8)` on `u0Val`'s assignment forces
 *    a redundant `andi 0xff` when it's later added into `u1Val`, which the
 *    target doesn't have (the `& mask` already leaves it byte-range; a
 *    second narrowing cast makes cc1 re-mask on reuse instead of trusting
 *    the first AND).
 *  - The empty `do { } while (0);` right after the `y += ph;` update is a
 *    load-bearing REGALLOC LEVER (found by tools/permute.py, ~4600 iters,
 *    score 0): with no barrier, cc1's scheduler hoists `u1Val = u0Val +
 *    iVar7;` to float BEFORE the `x`/`y` updates (same instructions, wrong
 *    order); the loop-note barrier pins it after, matching the target.
