/*
 * One source of truth for fixed MAIN.EXE memory contracts and configurable
 * RAM-budget policy.  tools/ram_layout.py reads the simple literal defines
 * below; linker generators must consume that module rather than repeat these
 * numbers. Canonical extraction/config inputs may still contain shipped
 * addresses as retail oracles; normal-link generators must translate those
 * inputs through this policy before they become runtime definitions.
 *
 * Section-owned objects such as StageChar, CamState, and D_80097D70 are NOT
 * layout constants.  Normal code must name their linker symbols so ordinary
 * growth moves them.  Earlier matching attempts used 0x80090000 high-half
 * scaffolds for three such objects; those removed local minima never described
 * a real "game globals" base.
