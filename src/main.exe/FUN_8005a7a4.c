/*
 * FUN_8005a7a4 (0x8005a7a4) — advance the memory-card save UI state machine.
 *
 * The target selects the new state into a register and does ONE store. A
 * ternary is NOT equivalent (cc1 duplicates the D_80097D32 store into both
 * arms, +8). Three constructs in the shared `update_count` tail are
 * load-bearing; each is measured, and removing any of them costs bytes.
 *
 * The tail's block is LOAD-FREE, so sched cannot reorder it (every insn_cost
 * is 1, so priority() collapses to 1 and nothing moves) — its order is expand
 * order, and the answer had to be source structure:
 *
 *   - `cond = value < 3;` ahead of the store. cc1 emits a compare and its
 *     branch TOGETHER from the MIPS branch expander (`cmpsi` only records the
 *     operands and emits nothing), so no statement can be parked between them;
 *     hoisting the compare into a local is the only way to emit `slti` before
 *     the store. It MUST be spelled `< 3`, never `> 2`: as a *value*, `> 2`
 *     goes through store_flag, which cannot put the constant in the immediate
 *     and folds to `lui`/`slt` against 2<<16 (measured: 13). `< 3` is
 *     store_flag's natural `slti` — the target's exact instruction.
 *
 *   - the do{}while(0) around the D_80097D32 store. A fence emits CODE_LABELs,
 *     i.e. a basic-block boundary, and that boundary is what pins the result:
 *       * combine will not merge the compare into the branch across it, so the
 *         `slti` stays put instead of being re-split back down at the branch.
 *         Without the fence the `cond` local is entirely byte-neutral (12).
 *       * reorg's backward delay-slot scan stops dead at the label — which is
 *         why the target's `bnez` keeps an empty delay slot even though the
 *         `sh` sits right before it and never touches v0.
 *     Both of the target's oddities come from that single boundary.
 *
 *   - the do{}while(0) around the D_80097D2E store buys next_state one
 *     loop-depth-weighted ref, winning it a0 (regalloc.py: `p83 > p117: needs
 *     +1 weighted ref`). It must enclose ONLY this read: wrapping the `if`
 *     would also double saved_state's refs, and its shorter live range would
 *     then outrank next_state and take a0 the wrong way.
 *
 * Measured, so nobody re-derives them: cond alone 12, fence alone 12, both 0;
 * unwrapping the D_80097D2E fence 7. Moving the store after the `if` lets
 * reorg take it into the delay slot: 1020 bytes, 4 short.
