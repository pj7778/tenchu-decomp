/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 33 of 248 bytes differ (whole-image count is a
 * fixed offset above that, from the other in-progress NON_MATCHING file in
 * this batch, FUN_8004a6bc — not from this function drifting downstream:
 * the length matches exactly, 248 bytes both).
 *
 * FUN_8003944c (0x8003944c, 0xf8 bytes) — EFFECT.C effect-pool allocator:
 * same EffectSlot[200] round-robin search as SetSplash/SetFrame/SetBleed/
 * FUN_80038fdc (see SetSplash.c for the full writeup of the shared idioms).
 * Unlike FUN_80038fdc, this one fills EVERY BloodType field straight from
 * its own 10 parameters (a raw "spawn a blood-family effect exactly as
 * told" setter, not a computed one like SetBlood.c) and hands the slot to
 * FUN_80033f10 (calls RotTransPers/GsSortSprite/GetScreenPosition — the same
 * callee DrawBlood.c uses — so FUN_80033f10 is almost certainly another
 * Draw* in this family). Called by DamageControl, ProcItemGosin and
 * ProcItemShinsoku (all still asm) — likely something like SetBloodDirect/
 * AddBloodEffect; no candidate in reference/psxsym-candidates.tsv to
 * corroborate.
 *
 * param_9/param_10 are stack args read with `lhu` (16-bit) even though
 * Ghidra types them `undefined1`/`uchar` and only their low byte is ever
 * stored (`sb`) — trusting the raw access width over Ghidra's guess
 * (cookbook: "Ghidra can mistype a stack-passed parameter's width").
 * effect.h's BloodType gained a real `unk22` field here: offset 0x22 was
 * previously unnamed alignment padding, but this function's `sb` store
 * there is a genuine write, not an artifact.
 *
 * Residual: field STORE order matches Ghidra's rendering exactly (pz, vy,
 * vz, scale, [rotate read but not yet stored — same "read early value,
 * store late" idiom as `py`], time, vx, unk22, bright, mode, py, rotate),
 * and the register set/length already match — but cc1's scheduler pushes
 * the scale-store+rotate-load PAIR later (next to the mode/py stores)
 * than the target (which places that pair right after `vz`, before
 * time/vx). Tried: an explicit `rot` temp at several statement positions,
 * reordering vx/time, autorules (no improving type edit) — all
 * byte-identical residual. This is a pure list-scheduling tie, not a
 * source-shape difference tools/autorules.py or manual reordering can
 * reach; `tools/permute.py FUN_8003944c` errored ("does not contain any
 * function") on its pycparser preprocessing pass rather than running —
 * a tooling gap worth fixing centrally, not something to work around by
 * hand here.
