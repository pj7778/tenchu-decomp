 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * GetTargetDistance (0x80029794, 0xd0 bytes) — same "Humanoid control" TU as
 * GetMoveSpeed.c/MoveHumanoid.c/GetHumanoid.c (HUMAN.C). Computes the planar
 * (x,z) distance from `human` to `human->target`, and *deg the signed turn
 * needed to face it (in the same 0x8000-scaled unit Degree/GetMoveSpeed's ry
 * use), biased +-0x1000 depending on whether the raw angle difference falls
 * in the "closest to zero" wedge.
 *
 * `human->target->locate.coord.t[0]/[2]` reach a GsCOORDINATE2's embedded
 * MATRIX.t[] world-position (ModelType.locate @0x00, MATRIX.t[] @0x14 within
 * it — 0x18/0x20 total, matching the asm's displacements).
 *
 * `vy` is a genuine narrow (`u16`) local: `human->rotate->vy` (SVECTOR.vy,
 * signed in the shared header — MoveHumanoid reads the SAME field with
 * `lh`) copied straight into a 16-bit destination reads `lhu` here (the
 * narrowing-use rule: the sign bits are dead once the value only ever feeds
 * a 16-bit copy). Declaring the temp `s32` (not `u16`) and casting only at
 * the assignment (`vy = (u16)human->rotate->vy;`) was required — an `s32`
 * temp assigned straight from the SIGNED field, or a `u16` temp, both cost
 * an extra `andi 0xffff` at the later use (a call-surviving u16 read wants
 * the "int t1 = cap;" idiom from the cookbook's spilled-u16-locals rule, not
 * a narrow-typed temp).
 *
 * The tail bias block (`if (sVar4 < 0x801) { if (-0x800 < sVar4) goto skip; }
 * else { sVar4 = -sVar4; } sVar4 = sVar4 + 0x1000;`) needed TWO changes to
 * match: (1) the shared trailing `sVar4 = sVar4 + 0x1000;` must be split into
 * a per-arm computation — the THEN arm keeps its own `sVar4 = sVar4 + 0x1000;`
 * and the ELSE arm becomes a single combined `sVar4 = 0x1000 - sVar4;`
 * (spelled as a subtraction from the materialized constant, not
 * `sVar4 = -sVar4;` followed by the old shared add — that emits a separate
 * `negu`+`addiu` where the target has one `li`+`subu`); and (2) the outer
 * if's THEN arm (the nested if+goto) is reached by a TAKEN branch and the
 * ELSE arm (single assignment) is the fallthrough — the opposite of ordinary
 * `if (cond) {A} else {B}` codegen (which negates `cond` and branches to B).
 * Per the cookbook's "if (cond) A; else B; makes A the fall-through and
 * negates cond" rule, forcing a DIRECT (non-negated) test that branches to
 * the THEN arm needs explicit gotos instead of if/else:
 * `if (cond) goto nested; <else-body>; goto skip; nested: <then-body>`.
 * Both changes together match; each alone left a residual.
