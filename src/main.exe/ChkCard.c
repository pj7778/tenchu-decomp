 * slot 0 and blocks on MemCardSync until it reports a result, returning that
 * result truncated to a short. `cmd` is MemCardSync's command out-param, which
 * this caller ignores; `result` is seeded with MemCardAccept's return and then
 * overwritten in place by MemCardSync, which is why both share one stack slot
 * in source. FormatCard.c is the same function over MemCardFormat.
