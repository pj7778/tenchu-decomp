 * GetVectorRotation (0x8003975c, 0xac bytes) — the aim-direction helper: given
 * two world points, writes the pitch (*rx) and yaw (*ry) that aim `start` at
 * `end`. Yaw is `ratan2` of the negated horizontal deltas; pitch is `ratan2` of
 * the vertical delta over the horizontal distance (`SquareRoot0` of dx²+dz²).
 *
 * The out-params are written as full words here. Callers (ReqItemArrow.c,
 * ReqItemLightningBolt.c) declare their own externs taking `u16 *`/`short *`
 * and read only the low half back with `lhu` — a per-TU narrowing, not this
 * function's own signature.
 *
 * Statement order is load-order significant: dx (vx), then dz (vz), then dy
 * (vy) — the deltas are computed in that order even though dy is consumed last.
