/*
 * SetNowMotion (0x80026f54) — start motion `mid` on a character, unless it's
 * already in the locked state 0x11 running a non-looping (loop == -1) motion.
 * On a successful UpdateMotion, latch the motion's high byte as the new status
 * and (when `move`) apply the motion's default order/side speed via MoveHumanoid.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - `mid` is kept as `mid << 16` in $s0 across the UpdateMotion call and used
 *    twice: `sra ,0x10` = (short)mid for the call arg, `sra ,0x18` =
 *    (char)(mid >> 8) for the status latch.
 *  - The guard is a real `||` with a comma: `status != 0x11 || (ret = 0,
 *    motion->loop != -1)` — ret is zeroed in the loop-test's branch delay slot.
 *  - UpdateMotion returns s16 here (item.h): its result is `ret`, tested short.
