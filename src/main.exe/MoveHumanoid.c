 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * MoveHumanoid (0x8002952c) — set a character's velocity vector from an
 * order/side speed pair, rotated by the character's facing (rotate->vy).
 * ordr/side are signed bytes stored in shorts, so 0x80..0xFF are re-signed
 * via `- 0x100`. Velocity = R(-sin,-cos) applied to (ordr, side), >> 12.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - The guard is the `||` form `if (ordr != 0 || side != 0) { move } else
 *    { stop }`, NOT `if (==0 && ==0) {stop} else {move}`: cc1 lays the THEN
 *    branch (the big compute) physically first, and the branch polarity is
 *    `bnez ordr -> move; beqz side -> stop`. The De-Morgan `&&` form inverts
 *    the side test (bnez) and puts the stop body first — wrong layout.
 *  - `int io = ordr;` is a real variable, distinct from the multiply operand
 *    copy `o`. It forces `(int)ordr` into ONE sign-extended pseudo (sll+sra,
 *    $s2) shared by the zero-test AND the `& 0xff80` byte-resign test across
 *    the rsin/rcos calls (so callee-saved). Inline `(int)ordr` in a `!= 0`
 *    test compiles to sll+bnez with NO sra, leaving nothing for the andi to
 *    reuse — it then re-ands the raw copy and the shared pseudo never forms.
 *  - The byte-resign writes a SEPARATE copy (`o = ordr - 0x100`, $s5), leaving
 *    the short param `ordr` ($s1, the subtraction source) and `io` ($s2) live.
 *    Three ordr-derived regs coexist across the calls.
 *  - `s = -rsin(...)` negates at the assignment; reorg steals `negu $s3` into
 *    the rcos delay slot, so -sin is live across rcos -> callee-saved ($s3),
 *    while -cos ($v1, no calls after) stays caller-saved.
