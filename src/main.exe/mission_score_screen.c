 * Post-mission score/high-score screen (0x80054B48, 0x121C bytes).
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING -- 401 of 4636 bytes differ (was 413; 433; 437; 476;
 * 498; 525; 1266).
 *
 * 2026-07-17 round-6: THE ten s7<->s8 SWAP IS SOLVED (the old INFEASIBLE
 * entry below was based on a MISIDENTIFIED pseudo; see "round-6" section).
 * s7/s8 register mentions now match the target exactly (4/4 and 13/13).
 * Exact target length (1159 instructions), frame 0x1B8, 60/60 calls; the whole
 * function is address-aligned except the LoadTIMAndFree arg copy (9 low) and
 * one +4/-4 skew pair (medal bgez delay nop vs the row draw's sra).  No
 * retail-name record in PSX.SYM/demo export.
 *
 * 2026-07-17 round-5 (Fable) landed identities (do not undo):
 * - THE LADDER FLIP (433 -> 413): draw 1 (the SV32 subtraction draw) reuses
 *   the FUNCTION-SCOPED `sprite` variable as its carrier (no macro-local
 *   drawnSprite).  The merged pseudo (draw-1 range + row range, disjoint)
 *   has refs 46+14 with prio ~35000, far above rowSprite's 17229, so it is
 *   allocated FIRST and takes s2; rowSprite (conflicting: sprite's row range
 *   sits inside rowSprite's) is pushed to s3, and the row `negative` +
 *   `sprite` land s2 — the exact target rotation of the whole row body.
 *   regalloc.py --compare 82 800 said +2 weighted refs; direct ref-padding
 *   dies to cse, but merging two same-home variables moves refs wholesale.
 * - Draw 1's x/y stores go through (sprite_) BEFORE `sprite = (sprite_);`:
 *   once the copy exists, cse's make_regs_eqv makes the LONGER-LIVED copy
 *   canonical (sprite outlives numberSprite) and rewrites the stores to s2;
 *   placing the stores before the copy keeps them on s6 (target).
 *   The declaration order of sprite/numberSprite does NOT matter (measured:
 *   canon follows live length, not pseudo number).
 *
 * 2026-07-17 round-4 (Fable) landed identities (do not undo):
 * - The ROW draw is its own macro (DRAW_SCORE_NUMBER_ROW32): s16 signedValue
 *   seeded from i+1 (HImode addiu a0,s4,1 — NO pre-extension of i), u16 value
 *   = signedValue (plain HImode move a1,a0 — no andi), draws through the
 *   pre-loop rowSprite pointer (no drawnSprite copy), and declares its OWN
 *   `negative` (target row uses s2 vs s3 elsewhere: per "one variable = one
 *   hard reg", the row's flag was a distinct local in the original).  This
 *   fixed value->a1 (incl. `move a1,s0` quotient reload), negu a1,a0, the
 *   j+two-arm sign shape, the y-store delay-slot fill, the backedge
 *   `addiu a0,s4,1` delay fill, and beqz s2 — the old rowValue->a0
 *   "hard-conflict p91" dissolved once value became the copy (born second)
 *   instead of the andi owner (born first).  476 -> 437.
 * - rowSprite = &number sits between i = 0 and rankSpriteBase = rankSprites
 *   (target order: move s4,zero / addiu sp,24 / addiu sp,96).  The old
 *   "separate rowNumber pointer spills rankSpriteBase" verdict was an
 *   artifact of the drawnSprite-copy shape; with _ROW32 there is no spill.
 *
 * Proven identities added this session (do not undo):
 * - insertedRank is a PLAIN s32 LOCAL, spilled by reload to sp+392: the
 *   li t0,-1/sw + lw t1/t2/t3 spill-reload sequence is reproduced exactly.
 *   tail shrank to {oldPad, pad, background}.
 * - Both rank-scan hit arms are `insertedRank = i; break;` INSIDE the loop:
 *   cc1 relocates loop-exiting arms to the function end (goNext arms first,
 *   then these, cross-jumped into ONE island `j join; sw a0,392(sp)`).
 *   An explicit source-level island (`goto`+label at the bottom) does NOT
 *   reproduce this (breaks the shared-jal cross-jump; wrong island order).
 * - The insert region uses a one-copy guard (`found = insertedRank`),
 *   block-scoped shift pointer, separate insert-block pointer (fresh lui),
 *   inline i-1 subscripts, and grades[i]=grades[i-1] BEFORE i--.
 * - rankColour = 128 alone at entry; the number-init brightness is
 *   `brightness = rankColour;` behind a do{}while(0) fence (the loop note
 *   stops cse1 from const-folding the copy AND stops sched1 hoisting; both
 *   effects are required to keep `move v0,s3` + the v0 anti-dependence that
 *   pins the lhu w/h loads after the r/g/b stores).
 * - Medal + row brightness are chained `r = g = b =` stores (reverse 22/21/20
 *   order) with brightness a plain (caller-saved) local; row uses if/else.
 * - numberSprite is TWO variables: a block-scoped init pointer and the
 *   loop-phase `numberSprite = &number` set before the main for(;;)
 *   (target re-materializes addiu s6,sp,24 in the preheader).
 * - number-init block has NO do{}while(0) fence before number.mx=0/my=0
 *   (the old "pivot reset boundary" fence was WRONG): removing it merges the
 *   pivot reset into the rgb block and lets the LoadTIMAndFree(tim) arg copy
 *   `move a0,s2` float up (target hoists it to the block top right after
 *   InitSprite).  This closed the ~80B block-rotation to a 9-insn shift and
 *   is the 525->498 win.  The a0=tim copy now stops just past the brightness
 *   fence (line ~c1c); it cannot reach the target's bf8 without deleting the
 *   brightness fence, and deleting THAT regresses (503) — so it is parked at
 *   the 9-insn residual.
 * - DRAW2/DRAW5 (the two draws after colons) pass numberSprite (move s2,s6
 *   class); other draws pass &number (fresh addiu).  The colon x-store is
 *   the OBJECT form `number.x = x_` (sp-direct, pinned at block top).
 * - The char loop keeps retail's dead attribute load via a site-local
 *   volatile read; its w>>1/h>>1 stores go through initSprite while the
 *   zero pivots recompute the bank address (SCORE_SPRITE_AT).
 * - The stock tail is direct indexing (displacement-folded 1036) — no
 *   unlock pointer; statePtr = (PersistentState *)0x80010000 behind a
 *   do{}while(0) fence supplies the s0 base for the layout=0xFF store
 *   (the lui fills the FUN_80038ce0 delay slot).
 *
 * REJECTED this session (do not repeat):
 * - Integer-sum (leSetEnemy) spellings for the rank/char initSprite address:
 *   cse then folds the pivot recomputation into the same register and the
 *   loops SHRINK.  The two coexisting shapes (main index-first, pivot
 *   base-first) remain unsolved; current draft keeps both length-neutral.
 * - `signedValue = expr; value = signedValue;` for DRAW2/row (coalesces,
 *   one short) and pasting the expression twice (cse does NOT fold, grows).
 * - A separate rowNumber pointer for the row draw (spills rankSpriteBase).
 * - Removing the i=0 entry fence (line ~320): regresses to 578.  Removing the
 *   brightness copy fence (line ~334): regresses to 503.  Both fences needed.
 * - Moving `ten = 10;`/`numberSprite = &number;` into the loop body: loop.c
 *   hoists them to the SAME preheader slot (before the /10 magic); no change.
 * - guided autorules on the 525 and 498 residuals: no genuine win (every
 *   candidate regresses or is a LOCAL-SHAPE regression).  Do not rerun broad.
 *
 * 2026-07-17 round-6 (Opus) landed identity — THE ten s7<->s8 SWAP (413->401):
 * - The old INFEASIBLE verdict ("15x gap, priority-infeasible") compared ten
 *   against THE WRONG PSEUDO.  The `priority 99` allocno is NOT rankSpriteBase
 *   — it is the SPILLED insertedRank (it has no disposition at all).  The real
 *   competitor is rankSpriteBase at priority 544 vs ten's 1375: a 2.5x gap,
 *   and `regalloc.py --compare 798 94` says plainly "needs +4 weighted ref(s)".
 *   ALWAYS confirm a pseudo's identity via its DISPOSITION before believing a
 *   priority verdict about it.
 * - Mechanism (global.c + flow.c, read directly): MIPS defines no
 *   REG_ALLOC_ORDER, so find_reg scans hard regs ASCENDING, and pass 0 can
 *   never claim a callee-saved reg for the first time (it ORs in the complement
 *   of regs_used_so_far).  So cross-call allocnos take s0..s7 then $30(fp/s8)
 *   strictly in PRIORITY order.  s8 is $30 — the LAST register — so the target
 *   putting the high-ref `ten` in s8 means ten is allocated LAST, i.e. ten must
 *   rank BELOW rankSpriteBase.  Priority is
 *     floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length * 10000 * size
 *   (global.c), and flow.c weights refs by `REG_N_REFS += loop_depth`.
 * - THE LEVER: `do{}while(0)` fences are REAL loop notes, so each nesting level
 *   adds +1 loop_depth to every ref inside it.  rankSpriteBase's single row-loop
 *   use, nested 4 fence levels deep, goes 4 -> 8 weighted refs; floor_log2 steps
 *   3 at 8, so its priority jumps 544 -> 1632, clearing ten's 1375.  It is then
 *   allocated first and takes s7; ten is pushed to $30.  This is surgical: 1632
 *   lands between p83 (3036) and p94 (1375), so NOTHING else moves.
 * - CAVEAT (honest): the 4-nested-fence spelling is SCAFFOLDING, a proxy for
 *   "the original's rankSpriteBase carries 8 weighted refs".  The mechanism is
 *   real and measured, but the original almost certainly reached 8 refs another
 *   way (e.g. 3 cse-surviving uses at main-loop depth == def@2 + 3*2 = 8).
 *   Finding that spelling should drop the ~32B this scaffolding costs elsewhere.
 * - Measured alternatives (all worse; do not retry): unwrapping the draw macros'
 *   fences drops ten 39->21 refs (1375->592) and needs only +1 ref on
 *   rankSpriteBase, but the unwrap itself costs ~50B and nets 419.  A single
 *   fence around the whole row body lifts ten's row use too (40 refs/1410) and
 *   does not flip.  Wrapper-unwrap + 3 fences (ten 874 / p798 952): 420.
 * - THE ROW GOTO-LOOP IS LOAD-BEARING: rewriting it as a real `do {...} while
 *   (i < 3)` (semantically identical, and the tempting "clean" shape since its
 *   loop note would flip the pair with NO fence scaffolding) REGRESSES TO 698 —
 *   the loop note lets loop.c hoist the row body's invariants and the whole row
 *   region re-derives.  The goto-loop must stay; that is why the flip has to be
 *   bought with fences instead.
 *
 * Remaining classes — RE-MEASURED at 401 (the old "498 bytes" list below was
 * stale; two of its entries are now closed).  A target-vs-draft register-mention
 * histogram (the cookbook's mega-pseudo diagnostic) comes back CLEAN: s0-s8 all
 * match exactly, so there is NO mega-pseudo here and the s2->s3 cascade the
 * round-5 ladder flip addressed is DONE (s2 148/148, s3 52/52).  s7/s8 is now
 * 4/4 and 13/13 (round-6, above).  Of the 144 differing rows, 85 are PURE
 * REORDER (identical insn text at a different address = scheduling), and only
 * 59 are real.  The real ones, largest first:
 *   - colon x=0x66 store deferral: `li t1,102`/`sh t1,4(s2)` x4 vs li/sh v0 (8
 *     insns, 32B) — the last big coherent class.
 *   - scan/shift/bank addu operand orders (addu v0,v0,s1 vs addu v0,sp,s1 etc).
 *   - the SV32 subtraction draw's v1/a0 role swap (lbu/subu/bgez/negu block).
 *   - entry a0/128 dbr delay-slot fill; LoadTIMAndFree arg copy 9 low
 *     (brightness-fence-blocked, above); rank/char bank-address hoist;
 *     row-loop transient +4 skew; GsSortSprite a2 schedules (the bulk of the
 *     85 reorder rows: target places `move a2,zero` early, we place it late).
 *
 * The local aggregates reproduce the original stack layout: packed
 * ScoreResult copy at sp+50, sprite banks at sp+60/sp+118, one GsIMAGE
 * scratch at sp+160 reused by all seven sprite initialisations.
 *
 * 2026-07-17 round-4 REJECTED (measured; do not repeat):
 * - Row s32 carrier with `sv = (s16)(i+1) << 16; ... sv >>= 16;` (in-place
 *   sll/sra pair like the target's 559a8/ac): correct-length head but the
 *   pair HOISTS to the block top (its statement's early LUID; the pair is
 *   sched-mobile) and the medal nop stays -> +1 insn overall.  The v2 s16
 *   spelling instead lets combine fold sra+bgez (one short) which exactly
 *   cancels the medal nop; both are the SAME parked ±4 pair.
 * - The medal bgez delay nop (target fills it with the `move a0,s0` arg
 *   copy): a second `medalSprite` pointer is REQUIRED (sbs+call via a0-born
 *   pre-branch), but every spelling that keeps its pseudo alive perturbs the
 *   global conflict web and flips draws 0/2/3's jump1 sign arms (their
 *   drawY-t0 carriers dissolve, j's vanish, -3 insns): initializer form
 *   aliases at expand (2 refs); declare-then-assign dies to cse1
 *   -fcse-skip-blocks (uses re-canoned to medal across the skipped
 *   brightness arm); do{}while(0) around the copy makes loop.c
 *   move_movables SUBSTITUTE it away (reg=reg movable); a dead `medal++`
 *   blocker (straight-line or arm-local, any position) preserves the copy
 *   and fills the slot EXACTLY like the target but always costs the
 *   drawY collateral.  4 candidate spellings measured 4624/4640; parked.
 *
 * 2026-07-16 round-3 closure (flat at 476; do not retry these):
 * - The drawY-carrier lead is CLOSED at the C level: for constant-y draws
 *   (5/7/8, y=-53/-36/-18) copy-prop/constant-rematerialization dissolves
 *   any carrier (seed AND store through it are strict no-ops), so it cannot
 *   pin y live to force v0/t1. The only computed-y site (the row draw) is
 *   separately blocked: rowValue->a0 is a p91 HARD-CONFLICT, which also
 *   produces the self-cancelling +4/-4 skew pair (medal nop / merged j).
 * - Draws 5/7/8's v0-vs-t1 shift is a sched1 y-load sink tied to their s16
 *   (lhu) value loads; jump restructuring regresses the matching sign branch.
 * - The bank-address base-first/base-last swap is cc1 address-selection, not
 *   spelling (subscript and cast-macro forms diverge identically).
 * - Other measured dead ends: rankColour entry fence (no-op), row value as
 *   i+1 (length) or (u16)(i+1) (480), y-seed/x-store fence (+2 insns),
 *   160 guided candidates (no improving path).
 * (Round-3's residual list is superseded: its "ten $s7<->$s8 x10
 * priority-infeasible" is SOLVED in round 6, and its "$s2->$s3 x13" is solved
 * by round 5's ladder flip.  Both verdicts were wrong; see above.)

/* The row site's carrier is an s16 whose HImode add needs NO pre-extension
 * of i (addiu straight off the promoted register); `value` is u16 so the
 * copy is a plain HImode move (no andi).  The sign test then emits the
 * carrier's sll/sra extension pair right before the branch — the carrier
 * dies there, so the extension result inherits its register.  Draws go
 * through the pre-loop rowSprite pointer directly (no drawnSprite copy). */
