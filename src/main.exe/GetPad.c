 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * GetPad (0x8001b144) — held-buttons for controller row `no`, slot zero.
 * The pad API represents a controller as `(row << 4) | slot`; converting `no`
 * to that ordinary encoded-port value before using both halves naturally emits
 * retail's sll16/sra12/sra4 chain.  Keeping the field address in `held` also
 * reproduces the target's address-materialisation order, just as GetRealPad's
 * matched source does.
 *
 * The earlier direct `PadPort[no][0]` draft was a local minimum: it made cc1
 * fold the conversion to sll16/sra16 and led to the incorrect claim that the
 * three-shift form required an inline-asm optimizer barrier.  The demo homolog
 * uses the same three shifts, and its line table separates the pointer setup
 * from the later held-field load, corroborating this human source structure.
