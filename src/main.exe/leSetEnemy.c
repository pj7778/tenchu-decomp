/*
 * leSetEnemy (0x8003cb7c, 0x8c bytes) — `le`=layout-enemy family (see
 * leResetPath.c for TEnemyLayout, recovered from the Ghidra type export):
 * finds the first dead slot (type == -1) in the enemy-layout table and, if
 * one exists, fills it in from the six parameters and returns its index;
 * returns -1 if the table is full.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - The search loop is a plain do-while with an early `goto found` (cc1
 *    strength-reduces `enemy[idx].type` to a walking pointer automatically,
 *    same as DrawEffect.c/leResetEnemyLayout.c).
 *  - The post-loop merge needs a SEPARATE `result` variable (not reusing
 *    `idx` itself for the found-vs-not-found sentinel): the cookbook's
 *    "pool-search cursor and its post-found continuation can be a separate
 *    pseudo" rule — this reproduces the target's fresh `li -1` at the merge
 *    (rather than CSE-ing the loop's own -1 sentinel register), fixing a
 *    4-byte/1-instruction length gap.
 *  - The guard-clause-with-two-returns exception applies in its LITERAL
 *    `== -1` sense here (`if (result == -1) return -1;` first, success
 *    falls through to its own `return result;` at the very end) — the
 *    opposite (Ghidra's literal `if (result != -1) {...} return -1;`)
 *    relocates the success block to a branch target and is 79 bytes off.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 33 of 140 bytes differ, all in the `enemy[result]`
 * address computation for the field stores. The draft is arithmetically
 * correct, the right length, and every field STORE matches (same values,
 * same order) — only the base/offset register choice for `&enemy[result]`
 * differs: the target computes the `idx*0x88` offset chain FIRST (into the
 * register that becomes the final address) and the `enemy` base SECOND
 * (matching EXPAND_SUM's documented mult-first rule); this cc1 compile
 * computes the base first and the offset second instead, ending up with the
 * same two instructions/operand-order but base and offset swapped between
 * $a0/$v1. Tried: the `(&enemy[0])[result]` index-first respelling that
 * fixed leAddPath.c's identical-looking tie (no effect here — that rule is
 * specific to struct-member array access through a pointer, not a top-level
 * array); a cached `TEnemyLayout *e = &enemy[result];` pointer (cookbook
 * warns this flips the addu order the WRONG way for an already-index-first
 * target, and empirically made no difference); reordering the `result`
 * copy-for-return relative to the field stores. autorules.py found no
 * mechanical win. tools/permute.py ran ~285 iterations (--stop-on-zero,
 * -j4, ~10 min bounded) and plateaued at score 60 (its best candidate
 * introduced a partial pointer cache for one field, not the full fix) —
 * below the C level, a local-alloc/expand_sum ordering tie, not a source
 * shape choice reachable from here.
