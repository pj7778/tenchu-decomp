/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 133 of 532 bytes differ, all downstream of a
 * SINGLE extra instruction (function is 1 instr / 4 bytes too long; every
 * byte after that point is just the resulting address shift, not a real
 * diff — see the root cause below).
 *
 * PutMap (0x8004b848, 0x214 bytes) — draws the pause-menu map: a diamond
 * POLY_XF4 wipe outline (fresh each call from the GPU work buffer) plus the
 * MapImage sprite, animated through a 3-state sequence in `PutMapMode`
 * (gp-relative, this TU's own): 0 = just opened (init the wipe position/
 * sound), 1 = wipe animating closed (draws a highlighted-outline "seam"
 * frame each tick, then slides `D_80097F6C` toward 0 by 0x28/tick), 2 =
 * fully closed (draws the player's on-map marker via `FUN_8003d768`, still
 * unmatched).
 *
 * `rgb` (PSX.SYM's declared local) is a brightness ramp derived from the
 * wipe position: `(0xA0 - D_80097F6C) / 4` — plain integer division by the
 * constant 4 (not a hand-written bias+shift): cc1 emits the
 * `if (t<0) t+=3; t>>=2;` guard automatically for INT division by a
 * power-of-2 constant (same lever as PutLifeBar's `mx/4`).
 *
 * `ply` is this call's POLY_XF4, borrowed from the GPU's rolling work
 * buffer (GsGetWorkBase/GsSetWorkBase, bumped by exactly `sizeof(POLY_XF4)`
 * via plain `ply + 1` pointer arithmetic) — same local `POLY_XF4`/`POLY_F4`/
 * `DR_TPAGE` layout SetPolyXF4.c defined (not in a shared header yet per
 * its own comment; redefined locally here, its second caller).
 *
 * Ghidra invents `(CamState.Owner)->model->locate.coord.t[0/2]` for the
 * mode-2 draw call's first two args — the raw asm actually reads through
 * `CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR` (a different, already-proven
 * `Humanoid *` global — item.h/FUN_8004a368.c/ProcItemLightningBolt.c),
 * NOT CamState; `->model` is item.h's `ModelArchiveType *model` @0x58, and
 * `.locate.coord.t[0]/.t[2]` are the MATRIX translation X/Z (offsets
 * 0x18/0x20 from `model`, matching the raw `lw 0x18(v1)`/`lw 0x20(v1)`).
 * The 3rd arg is `&D_8008E50C[StageID]` (a still-unnamed per-stage table,
 * stride 0x10). NOTE: D_8008E50C/D_80097F6C/D_80097F70 were only
 * auto-labeled by splat while PutMap's OWN asm carve referenced them; once
 * this file compiles as plain C, nothing else references them, so they
 * needed explicit `config/symbols.main.exe.txt` entries (same lever as
 * LifeBarStyle in PutLifeBar.c) — first hit here, worth remembering for
 * any OTHER TU where you're the last matcher touching a shared small.
 *
 * The dispatch on `PutMapMode` (values 0/1/2, no default) MUST be written
 * as a real `switch`, not an if/else-if ladder: only `switch` reproduces
 * the target's `lbu`-once + SIGNED `slti` compare (an if/else-if ladder
 * over this exact same u8 read compiles the "smart" UNSIGNED `sltiu`
 * instead — verified by isolated cc1 experiment; neither `signed char` nor
 * an explicit cast reproduces `lbu`+`slti` together, only genuine switch
 * lowering does). Case bodies are laid out in SOURCE order 0,1,2 — the
 * TEST order (1, then <2, then 2) differs from body order (cookbook
 * Dispatch: "case-body memory order reveals the source case order").
 * The x0/y0/x1/y1/x2/y2/x3/y3 POLY_XF4 field assignments must be
 * INTERLEAVED (x0,y0,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3), not grouped (y0..y3 then x0..x3,
 * matching Ghidra's rendering) — grouped order ties two of the four
 * repeated-constant registers to the wrong class (a0/v1 swapped),
 * cascading through ~15 register-only diffs; interleaved order matches
 * the target exactly with no register diffs at all.
 *
 * Residual (root-caused): case 2's body needs
 * `CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR`'s address materialized in the
 * case-2 test branch's OWN delay slot (reorg speculatively hoists it there
 * since the slot is otherwise free — the branch's fallthrough is
 * unreachable "no case matched" dead code). This draft's delay slot
 * instead gets `D_8008E50C`'s address (the call's 3rd argument, evaluated
 * in a different order than the source list) — one extra instruction.
 * Tried and had no effect: introducing a named `Humanoid *h =
 * CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR;` before the call (to force its
 * evaluation first). A short bounded permuter probe found no candidate.
