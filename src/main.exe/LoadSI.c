/*
 * LoadSI (0x8005c2c4, 0x140 bytes total: entry + 2 override pieces) — the
 * debug-menu file loader: target==0 loads a whole-stage resource by name
 * from the CD/host filesystem (FileRead); target!=0 loads it from the
 * memory card (BISLPS_00000-prefixed save slot), staging through an 8KB
 * scratch buffer and skipping the first 0x200-byte card-file header before
 * copying the real 0x1E00-byte payload into the returned buffer.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 7 of 80 bytes differ (structural fidelity is
 * complete: arithmetic, control flow, frame layout, and every symbol/gp fix
 * below are verified correct; the residual is purely register allocation).
 * The draft uses TWO extra callee-saved registers ($s3/$s4 vs the target's
 * $s0-$s2) to CACHE `&cmd`/`&result` across the two `MemCardSync(0,&cmd,
 * &result);` call sites; the target instead RECOMPUTES `addiu
 * $a1,$sp,0x20E0` / `addiu $a2,$sp,0x20E4` fresh at each site with no
 * persistent register. Since GCC 2.8.1's allocator has no rematerialization
 * (once a pseudo gets a hard reg via global-alloc, it keeps it for its whole
 * live range — no IRA/LRA-style respill-on-demand), avoiding the cache
 * requires cc1 to see the two `&cmd`/`&result` occurrences as genuinely
 * unrelated expressions, not one CSE'd value spanning the gap. Tried and
 * ruled out: a `do{}while(0)` wrapper around each MemCardSync call
 * (unrelated instructions shifted; same 2-extra-register outcome); an
 * explicit `if (result!=0 && result!=3) goto card_error;` goto-ladder in
 * place of the `if (…||…) {…} else {…}` (byte-for-byte identical output —
 * the merge point's predecessor count doesn't change). The `if(…||…)` body
 * IS a genuine 2-predecessor label (reached by both the first test's taken
 * jump and the second test's fallthrough), which per the cookbook should
 * block cse's cross-block value reuse — it evidently doesn't here. Root
 * cause not fully pinned; a `cc1 -dg`/`-di` RTL dump bisection would be the
 * next step, or accept as the permuter's "same-length…" case doesn't apply
 * (this residual is NOT same-length: 87 vs 80).
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - Register mapping in PSX.SYM ($s0=name, $s1=ret) is the DEMO build's —
 *    retail's asm caches `name` in $s2 (moved out of $a1 at function entry,
 *    before $a1 is reused for the first sprintf's format arg) and the
 *    valloc'd/returned buffer in $s0. Only the local COUNT/TYPES carry over;
 *    one `ret` variable serves BOTH return paths (FileRead's result on the
 *    target==0 path, valloc's buffer otherwise) — matches PSX.SYM's 6 named
 *    locals (ret/fn/msg/cmd/result/block) with no extra `puVar1`.
 *  - `block` is ONE 8192-byte buffer, not Ghidra's two overlapping locals
 *    (auStack_2018/auStack_1e18): MemCardReadFile fills all 0x2000 bytes,
 *    and the payload copy reads `block + 0x200` (skipping a 512-byte card
 *    header) — cookbook "Stack objects": overlapping Ghidra locals are one
 *    buffer plus a cast.
 *  - Stack locals declared in ADDRESS order (fn@0x18, block@0xE0, cmd@0x20E0,
 *    result@0x20E4) to reproduce the 0x20F8 frame exactly.
 *  - `D_80097D8C` is this TU's gp small (a `char *` POINTER variable itself,
 *    not an array — the asm `lw a2,%gp_rel(D_80097D8C)($gp)` loads its
 *    VALUE); Build.hs maspsxGpExterns / tools/gpsyms.py confirm it's the
 *    only %gp_rel symbol in this function.
 *  - D_80097D90/D_80097D98 sit in the same INFOVIEW.C string-table run as
 *    SelectCameraOwnerOption's D_80097D70 (fixed there as D_80097D70);
 *    once that anchor was bound, splat's whole auto-name chain for this
 *    region resolved correctly (verified against the .map) — no separate
 *    fix needed for these two.
