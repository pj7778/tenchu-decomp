/*
 * GetArcData (0x8004f37c, 0xd0 bytes) — lazily loads "models.arc" via
 * FileRead into the gp-relative global MODEL_ARCHIVE_PTR (defined in this
 * TU, hence gp-addressed — see the cookbook's gp section), one-time-converts
 * its table of `count` relative offsets (each stored where it will end up
 * holding an absolute pointer — same slot reused for both, like
 * ProcItemDrop's shared-constant idiom but here for a whole table) into
 * absolute pointers via `entry[i] += (char *)arc + 4` (the "+4" skips the
 * {count,loaded} header word), marks `loaded` so the conversion only runs
 * once, then returns `entry[index]` after validating `index` against
 * `count`.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - The conversion must go through a temp: `t = entry[i] + 4; entry[i] =
 *    (s32)arc + t;`. Writing it as one expression (either operand order)
 *    lets fold-const's `associate` combine the invariant `arc + 4` into one
 *    loop-hoisted register, an extra callee-saved reg the target doesn't
 *    have — splitting the statement keeps `arc` and the per-iteration `+4`
 *    in separate sub-expressions so nothing invariant-with-a-constant is
 *    left for loop.c to hoist.
 *  - `arc->count > zero` (a fresh `s32 zero = 0;` local) instead of the
 *    equivalent `> 0` literal fixes a pure a0/a1 register SWAP between `arc`
 *    and the loop counter `i` (12 bytes, permuter-found, no length/
 *    instruction change) — adding one more pseudo shifts global-alloc's
 *    pseudo-number tie-break enough to flip which of the two competing
 *    variables lands in which hard reg. Cheaper than a full permuter run
 *    once you suspect this class of tie: try naming a literal operand
 *    through a same-valued local first.
