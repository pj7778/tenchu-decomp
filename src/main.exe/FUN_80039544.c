/*
 * FUN_80039544 (0x80039544, 0xcc bytes) — same camera-relative-transform +
 * perspective-project shape as the twin FUN_800396c0.c (same TU: see
 * FUN_80039610.c/PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c for the scratchpad MATRIX/SVECTOR idiom),
 * but instead of writing OTZ into a caller-supplied output pointer, it reads
 * RotTransPers's packed screen (x,y) back off its own stack scratch and
 * tail-calls DrawTargetS(x, y, otz - 5, arg3) — a line-draw/sort helper
 * (DrawTargetS's only other caller, FUN_8003d768, is also unmatched).
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `arg0 - (short)ViewInfo.vpx` etc. — same NARROWING lhu-of-a-s32-global
 *    rule as the twin.
 *  - RotTransPers's `sxy` out-param is two adjacent stack shorts (x,y, not
 *    one s32): declared as separate locals matching Ghidra, since the
 *    caller reads them back via two independent `lh`s rather than one
 *    shift-derived pair.
 *  - Scratchpad zero/coordinate stores are FLAT `*(s32/s16 *)0x1F8000xx`
 *    casts, one macro expansion each (repeated fresh `lui $at,0x1F80` per
 *    store) — NOT a shared cached `MATRIX *`/`SVECTOR *` local like
 *    FUN_800396c0.c/PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c use for the same scratchpad region: this
 *    function's asm never reuses one register across the individual
 *    zero/coordinate stores, unlike the twins.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 51 of 204 bytes differ (same length, no diffs
 * outside this function's own window). Every field/argument VALUE and the
 * scratchpad addressing already match; the residual is that the target
 * caches `&x` (the RotTransPers `sxy` out-arg's address) into a
 * callee-saved register ($s0) and reuses it to store the truncated OTZ
 * result (`sh v0,4(s0)`) after the call, then reloads x/y/otz via plain
 * `lh`s off $sp for the DrawTargetS call — while this compile computes
 * `&x` straight into the argument register (no persisting alias) and keeps
 * OTZ live in a register across the truncate/-5 instead of round-tripping
 * it through memory. Tried: taking `&x` into an explicit local pointer and
 * storing OTZ through `p+2` (regressed — forced an unrelated extra
 * callee-saved register for `y`, since introducing the pointer variable
 * disturbed unrelated allocation); the same via an inline
 * `*(short*)((s32*)&x+1)` double-dereference with no named pointer (same
 * regression). autorules.py found no mechanical win. tools/permute.py ran a
 * bounded (~10 min, -j4) search; see its result before doing more surgery
 * here — if it plateaus, this is a frame-address-argument caching decision
 * (calls.c precompute_register_parameters) triggered by the OTZ store's
 * reuse of the SAME address, not a shape this source has found yet.
