/*
 * FUN_8004f770 (0x8004f770, 0x44 bytes) — generic table search: walks a
 * caller-supplied array of 6-byte records (only the first byte, an ID, is
 * read here) looking for one whose ID matches `arg1`, returning a pointer to
 * the matching record or NULL; the table is terminated by an ID byte of
 * 0xFF. Sound TU (address-contiguous with FUN_8004f68c/FUN_8004fbf4/
 * PlayMusicFormID/SetupSoundEffect/Sound), no direct `jal` callers found —
 * reached indirectly or from an unsplit caller.
 *
 * A `while (cond) {...}` whose initial value isn't a provable constant keeps
 * BOTH the entry test and the rotated bottom test (cookbook Loops); here the
 * two tests are physically the same comparison (`*arg0 != 0xFF`) re-emitted
 * at the entry and at the loop bottom, exactly the classic
 * duplicate_loop_exit_test shape, not two different conditions.
