 *
 * void AVCameraControl(void);
 *     CHRANIM.C:322, 44 src lines, frame 40 bytes, saved-reg mask 0x80070000 (DEMO build -- see below)
 *
 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     stack sp+16     struct SVECTOR vect
 *     reg   $s1       long xx
 *     reg   $s0       long zz
 *     reg   $s2       long len
 *     reg   $a1       short ry
 *
 * Globals it touches, as the original declared them:
 *     extern struct GsRVIEW2 ViewInfo;
 *     extern short CameraPanMode;
 *     extern struct Humanoid *CameraTarget;
 *     extern struct tag_TItem items[30];
 * END PSX.SYM */

/*
 * AVCameraControl (0x80051228) — applies the active cutscene-camera pan
 * mode: normal camera update, orbit rotation, vertical pan, zoom, or target
 * lock, then submits the updated ViewInfo.
 *
 * STATUS: MATCHING — 0x1F4 bytes plus the 9-word jump table.
 *
 * The 2/3 and 6/7 arms contain source-level GetMoveSpeed calls whose common
 * call sequence is merged by cross-jump. The short `ry` needs two ordinary
 * wide copies in the 2/3 arm: `move_base` preserves its signed extension,
 * while `speed` preserves D_80097CC8's signed load. Both optimize away as
 * storage, but without them cc1 uses modulo-short `lhu` arithmetic and
 * coalesces the input/result into the wrong register.
