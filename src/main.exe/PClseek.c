 * PClseek (0x80060224) — PC-file lseek stub (part of the PCopen/PCclose/
 * PClseek/PCcreat/PCinit/PCread/PCwrite host-file-I/O family; "Possible
 * LSEEK.OBJ/PClseek" per Ghidra, i.e. a PsyQ CRT library object). It shifts
 * its 3 args up one register slot (fd:$a0->$a1, offset:$a1->$a2, mode:$a2->
 * $a3) and executes a raw `break 0x0,0x107` (MIPS trap/syscall exception) —
 * the PS1 BIOS's host-link mechanism for a real lseek() when running under a
 * dev kit. Ghidra models the two BIOS outputs as bare incoming registers
 * `in_v0`/`in_v1` (error code / result): `if (in_v0 != 0) in_v1 = -1; return
 * in_v1;`.
 *
 * STATUS: the guarded reference reconstruction is byte-exact (0/36).  Fresh
 * comparison shows that the demo body at 0x80051494 is also all 36 bytes
 * identical to retail, with no PSX.SYM C translation-unit or line records.
 * This is a stable HANDWRITTEN-ASSEMBLY library object, not a C function stuck
 * in an allocator local minimum.  Three independent tells agree:
 *
 *   1. `break 0, 263` (0x107) is the ONLY two-operand break in the entire
 *      image. The compiler's own trap codes appear in bulk — `break 7`
 *      (divide-by-zero) 139 times, `break 6` (overflow) 131 times — because
 *      cc1 emits them from mips.md. 263 belongs to no cc1 pattern: it is the
 *      host-link trap code the dev kit's handler dispatches on. A compiler
 *      does not emit a code it does not own.
 *   2. The args are shifted UP one register (fd:$a0->$a1, offset:$a1->$a2,
 *      mode:$a2->$a3) so the trap handler can read them from $a1-$a3. No C
 *      calling convention produces that; it only makes sense hand-written
 *      against a handler's private ABI.
 *   3. `$v1` is read as a SECOND return value alongside `$v0` (error code /
 *      result), which the MIPS C ABI has no way to express — and the target's
 *      own branch label is `LSEEK_OBJ_1C`, i.e. the original object's label
 *      survived into the image.
 *
 * Under docs/gte-policy.md's owner-approved rule (proven handwritten =>
 * the asm is canonical => counted done), this belongs in
 * config/handwritten-asm.txt alongside the GTE family. It is NOT listed there
 * yet: membership is attributed to an explicit owner decision, so the addition
 * remains flagged for ratification rather than taken unilaterally.  The exact
 * guarded reconstruction below records the private trap ABI without changing
 * that project classification.
 *
 * (Note this is SDK code — 0x80060224 is above the 0x80060000 game boundary —
 * so it does not affect the game-code scoreboard either way.)
 *
 * The former pure-C investigation, kept for the record:
 *
 * 1. `break 0x0,0x107` has NO C representation at all — the only way to
 *    emit it is inline asm with register-pinned variables (confirmed
 *    working below: `register int x __asm__("$5") = fd;` etc., feeding a
 *    `break` instruction via extended asm).  It is retained only inside this
 *    guarded reference for an original already proven to be assembly.
 * 2. Tool finding (reusable): maspsx's `break` handling
 *    (`maspsx/__init__.py`, `elif op == "break"`) expects the SINGLE-value
 *    form (`break 0x107`) and itself splits it into the two 10-bit fields —
 *    NOT the two-operand disassembly form (`break 0, 263`) Ghidra/objdump
 *    print; the latter makes maspsx raise `invalid literal for int() with
 *    base 0: '0,'`.
 * 3. Before the handwritten control tail was retained, the C draft had a
 *    stubborn 7-byte register-materialization-timing residual.  The target
 *    computes the result into $v0 EARLY (a `move v0,v1` in the `beqz`'s
 *    delay slot, so
 *    both the success path (v0=v1) and the error path (v0=-1) leave the
 *    answer in $v0 well before the epilogue, which is then a bare `nop`),
 *    whereas cc1 here keeps the value in the trap's own $v1 output
 *    throughout (a zero-cost coalesce — "result = r_v1" is free once r_v1
 *    is pinned to $3) and only inserts the ABI-mandated $v1->$v0 move at the
 *    true `return` (the LAST possible point, not the first). Tried: a
 *    shared `result` local (same outcome — coalesces with r_v1 regardless),
 *    two early returns (`if(err) return -1; return r_v1;` — fixes the
 *    v0/v1 choice but cc1 no longer cross-jumps the two returns into one
 *    epilogue, costing a whole extra `j ra` = wrong length), reusing r_v0
 *    itself as the accumulator (same extra-epilogue problem), and a ternary
 *    return (different wrong shape: routes through $a0 as scratch instead).
 *    This is a genuine sub-C-level control-flow boundary, not a source-shaping
 *    or register-allocation problem.
 * RE-VERIFIED (a later session, RTL-dump-backed): re-derived the mechanism
 * independently via tools/rtldump.py --draft on the `.i.greg`/`.i.jump`
 * dumps rather than trusting this header's prose. Confirmed: the shared-
 * `goto done; done: return ret;` shape allocates `ret` straight into hard
 * reg 3 (v1) — `.i.greg` shows "88 preferences: 3" / "88 in 3" — because
 * `ret = r_v1` is a free coalesce once r_v1 is pinned to $3; the single
 * ABI $v1->$v0 copy then lands at the merge block (`.i.greg` insn 41),
 * exactly the observed 7-byte residual. Tried BOTH orderings of two literal
 * `return` statements (`if(err) return -1; return ok;` AND the branch-sense-
 * flipped `if(ok) return ok; return -1;`, matching the target's `beqz`
 * sense) — `.i.jump` shows both give each arm its OWN independent v0
 * materialization (the desired shape, `insn 35: v0=v1` / `insn 28: v0=-1`)
 * but ALSO an unconditional `jump_insn` from the fallthrough arm to the
 * merge label (block layout always places the branch-target arm textually
 * AFTER the fallthrough arm, so the fallthrough needs an explicit jump over
 * it) — confirmed via matchdiff: "LENGTH MISMATCH — 40 bytes" both times,
 * not just "differs". This cc1 does not perform the target's layout (placing
 * the taken-arm's one-instruction body into the branch's own delay slot to
 * avoid needing a jump at all) from any two-return C shape tried.  Four
 * independent shapes converged on the same two local optima
 * (7-off/right-length or 4-over/wrong-length).
 * tools/permute.py was attempted as the final bounded step per protocol but
 * could not be completed cleanly in this sandbox (harness auto-backgrounds
 * bash calls exceeding ~2 minutes regardless of an inner `timeout`, so the
 * "foreground, bounded" invocation kept detaching); killed after several
 * minutes of real permuter activity with no zero found.
 *
 * The exact #else reconstruction keeps the trap, branch, success-result copy
 * in its delay slot, and error `-1` as one coherent handwritten unit; cc1 emits
 * only the ordinary final `jr ra`/`nop`.  The default build retains the
 * byte-identical two-piece INCLUDE_ASM body.  LSEEK_OBJ_1C is this function's
 * own epilogue, not a separate routine; splat carved it separately only because
 * the original object label survived in symbols.main.exe.txt.
