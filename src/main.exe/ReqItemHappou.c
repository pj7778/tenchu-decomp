/*
 * ReqItemHappou (0x80044b18) — fire an 8-shot "happou" volley (8 homing
 * projectiles fanned out by a random jitter on the aim direction). Twin of
 * ReqItemArrow/ReqItemLaunch (same item TU, same pool round-robin on
 * COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_, same dispose-on-exhaustion block, same
 * cur/it two-pseudo pool search, same SetupFly+SetupAfterimage tail as
 * ReqItemLaunch); unlike every other twin the OUTER shape is a
 * while(1)+break loop firing the whole allocate-and-launch sequence 8 times
 * (SetNowMotion once up front, Sound once after all 8, `p->end` reused as
 * scratch OUTPUT storage for SearchItemTarget2 on every iteration). Unlike
 * ReqItemArrow/Launch, `it->model` is never touched at all (this item has no
 * visible sprite, only the afterimage trail), and SetupAfterimage's first
 * arg is `it->locate` (ModelType*) — NOT `it->model` like ReqItemLaunch's
 * call to the same function (respelled per-TU, see below).
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - The outer loop is the cookbook's `while (1) { if (!(cond)) break; ...}`
 *    shape: `j < 8` is a real TOP test (not folded away like a provable-
 *    constant `for`/`while` would be) because loop.c only rotates a
 *    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` immediately followed by a simplejump — the
 *    condjump-first shape here keeps the top test AND still gets invariant
 *    hoisting: `items + COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_`'s `&items[0]` half is
 *    hoisted all the way past BOTH loop levels (computed once, before the
 *    outer loop, from the same unmodified `cur = items + COUNTER...;`
 *    expression the single-shot twins use — no separate cached-base
 *    variable needed in source).
 *  - Same `cur`/`it` two-pseudo pool search as ReqItemArrow/Launch (the
 *    stub-jump early-exit pattern confirmed in the raw .s).
 *  - `pp = it->param;` before the null check, same lever as every twin;
 *    reused for SetupFly's 1st arg and the two final raw stores.
 *  - `st = &p->start;` sits in the SAME position as every twin (right after
 *    the direct `p->start.vx` read, before the st->vy/st->vz reads) and,
 *    unlike ReqItemArrow, stays live (no register reuse forcing a
 *    recompute) all the way to SetupFly's 2nd arg — reused 4 times total.
 *  - `it->locate->rotate = p->user->model->rotate;` and the local `dir =
 *    p->user->model->rotate;` are TWO INDEPENDENT struct copies, each
 *    re-reading `p->user->model` fresh (confirmed: two separate `lw` pairs
 *    in the raw .s, not a cached pointer) — an SVECTOR (align-2) copy
 *    compiles to `lwl/lwr`+`swl/swr` word pairs per the cookbook's
 *    alignment-drives-copy-code rule.
 *  - The random jitter is a plain signed `r % 512`: `dir.vy = dir.vy +
 *    (r % 512 - 0x100);` reassociates via fold-const.c into the target's
 *    `dir.vy - 0x100 + r%512` layout (same "A - C + B" lever as the
 *    cookbook's `rand() % 1000 - 500` example) and the sign-correcting
 *    bias/shift dance for a negative dividend is entirely automatic from
 *    the natural `%` (no hand-rolled staging needed).
 *  - `en = &p->end;` computed once, reused for both SearchItemTarget2's 4th
 *    arg and SetupFly's 3rd arg (same "computed once, read multiple times"
 *    shape as `st`).
 *  - **`j++;` (the outer counter) belongs AFTER `SetupFly`, not textually
 *    before `SearchItemTarget2` where Ghidra renders it** (found via the
 *    permuter after manual placement stalled at CURRENT(46) — a pure
 *    register-allocation tie, not a structural difference). Ghidra/the raw
 *    `.s` show the increment in `SearchItemTarget2`'s call delay slot, which
 *    reads as "the statement right before this call" — but that's just
 *    where reorg happened to schedule it FROM; the true source statement is
 *    several lines later, and reorg pulled the independent increment
 *    BACKWARD across the SearchItemTarget2 call into that delay slot. Don't
 *    trust a delay-slot instruction's apparent position as its source
 *    position — only that it's independent of the call's own effects.
 *  - No `it->model` store at all (unlike ReqItemArrow/Launch) — this item
 *    has no sprite.
 *  - `SetupAfterimage(it->locate, 10)` — first arg is `ModelType *`
 *    (it->locate), not `Sprite3D *` (it->model) like ReqItemLaunch's call to
 *    the same function; each TU respells the callee's prototype to match
 *    its own call site (same situation as GetVectorRotation's out-param
 *    width across ReqItemDefault/ReqItemArrow/ReqItemLightningBolt).
 *  - The afterimage vector constants (0x1e/-0x1e, vy=vz=0) and struct shape
 *    are identical to ReqItemLaunch's; only the trailing count (8, not 5)
 *    and the two raw pp-offsets differ.
