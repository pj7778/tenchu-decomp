 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
