/*
 * SetupCharacterParameter (0x80029ea4, 0x174 bytes) — resolves `type` to its
 * row in the sentinel-terminated HumanData[] table (linear search on
 * .type == -1) and copies the per-type stats (turn/width/height/life) plus
 * motion setup (SetupMotionRegist/SetupMotionManager) into `human`; then
 * resolves a second, unrelated "how manieth non-player kind on this stage"
 * count via CHARACTER_KINDS_PER_STAGE[NowStage] (another sentinel-
 * terminated, per-stage short list) into human->sound. item.h's proven
 * Humanoid layout (turn@0x6/life@0x8/lifemax@0xA/width@0xC/height@0xE/
 * model@0x58/motion@0x5C/sound@0xAC) accounts for every field written here.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `int idx` (not `short`) lets loop.c strength-reduce the repeated
 *    `HumanData[idx].type` into a walking pointer INSIDE the first loop
 *    (the target's `addiu $v1,$v1,0x18` stride) while `idx` itself survives
 *    the loop (recomputed via `idx*0x18` afterward, since the giv pointer
 *    dies at loop exit) for the later `HumanData[idx].*` field reads —
 *    exactly the Loops "recompute-from-base" + coexisting biv/giv shape.
 *    A NAMED temp/pointer local for the compared field (Ghidra's own
 *    `sVar1`/`sVar2`/`pHVar4`) is a decompiler SSA artifact here, not real
 *    source — introducing one (tried a `sid`/`val` temp and a `phum`
 *    walking pointer literally matching Ghidra's rendering) makes cc1
 *    hoist/CSE the loop's OWN first-iteration test into an extra branch
 *    right after the entry guard, one instruction too many. Plain re-
 *    indexed `HumanData[idx].type` / `idtbl[idx]` in BOTH the loop
 *    condition and the body's break test is what reproduces the target's
 *    two separate `lh` reloads (one per test) with no extra branch.
 *  - `idtbl` (proven `short *` by PSX.SYM) is indexed (`idtbl[idx]`),
 *    reusing the SAME `idx` from the first search, not walked with its own
 *    increment/pointer arithmetic — mirrors the first loop's shape exactly
 *    (an `int idx` giv lets loop.c strength-reduce this to a walking
 *    pointer too, matching the target's `addiu $v1,$v1,2` stride).
 *  - The two searches are mirror-image sentinel/match loop shapes: the
 *    first loops "while not at the sentinel" (breaking early on a match),
 *    the second loops "while not yet matched" (breaking early on the
 *    sentinel) — each a plain `while`, jump.c duplicating each loop's OWN
 *    continue-condition to the entry.
 *  - `HumanData[idx].life` is read ONCE into a temp and stored to both
 *    lifemax and life (one `lhu` feeding two `sh`s) — a plain two-statement
 *    transcription would reload it twice.
