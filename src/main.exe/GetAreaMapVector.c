 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — exact 548-byte extent, with 33 bytes still
 * different.  The persistent register assignment now matches retail
 * (mvp=$s0, pos=$s2, wide=$s7, x=$s6, y=$s3, z=$s5, raw mode=$s1,
 * cached mode=$s4, truncated mode=$fp), and the loop plus normal return path
 * are byte-exact.  Keep the INCLUDE_ASM guard: the remaining differences are
 * four localized scheduling/constant-equivalence groups in the setup and
 * MIN early-return path.
 *
 * GetAreaMapVector (0x80019ea0) — probes the height at `pos` plus the height
 * of the 4 neighbouring cells listed in the static `direction` table
 * (dx/dz pairs, scaled by `wide`), and packs the result into *mvp: level,
 * a height delta, the found area's attrib/area-ptr/index-ptr, and 3 bitmasks
 * over the 4 directions (`vector` = blocked, `angleL`/`angleH` = level went
 * up/down). Returns mvp->level. `mvp` is NOT a bare MapVector (game_types.h's
 * shared typedef is only the 8-byte level/height pair used elsewhere) — this
 * function writes a bigger 0x18-byte record (StickonCheck.c's header notes
 * the true record is 0x20 bytes; this function only touches the first 0x18),
 * matching the canonical MapVector layout (psxsym-types.h) through 0xF plus
 * two pointer fields (area/index) tacked on at 0x10/0x14 that PSX.SYM's
 * MapVector struct doesn't list — a per-file extended local view, same
 * convention as AreaMapVectorResult in StickonCheck.c.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `i`/`v` are `short` (PSX.SYM) — a short loop counter suppresses loop.c's
 *    strength reduction, so `&direction[i]` recomputes base+i*4 from scratch
 *    every iteration instead of walking a pointer (matches the asm: no
 *    hoisted `direction` base address, even though the loop otherwise gets
 *    normal invariant hoisting for the `(u16)mode` argument).
 *  - The `level == MIN` branch's `mvp->height = 0` runs UNCONDITIONALLY
 *    (a delay-slot fill in the real asm) even on the `mode & 4` path that
 *    skips the early return — write it before the inner `if`, not inside it.
 *  - The post-first-call height delta re-reads `pos->vy` directly (a fresh
 *    load), not the cached `y` local also used by the loop — matches the
 *    asm doing an actual memory reload there instead of reusing $s3.
 *  - A `do { } while (0);` right after the setup remains load-bearing: its
 *    loop notes give the MIN comparison the target allocation/scheduling
 *    shape without emitting a runtime loop.
 *  - Keeping both the raw full-width mode and a cached full-width mode needs
 *    two source identities. `rawmode = (mode2 = mode)` followed by identical
 *    `mode = rawmode` arms defeats copy propagation without leaving a branch;
 *    the loop then retains its in-loop `andi` on the cached value.
 *  - The duplicated wide/y early-return tails are allocation donors only.
 *    jump2 removes the redundant CFG, while global allocation sees enough
 *    extra references to select the retail homes for wide, y, and the cached
 *    mode. Duplicating the complete tail (rather than only `attrib = 2`) also
 *    recovers retail's `li 2`/attrib-store ordering.
 *  - `initial_level` preserves the first call result for the early return;
 *    the normal height calculation deliberately re-reads `mvp->level`.
 *
 * THE RESIDUAL is limited to: setup loads ordered mode/y/z instead of y/z/mode;
 * the cached-mode move scheduled before rather than after the three Field*
 * loads; the FieldArea store and MIN `lui` exchanged; and the early-return
 * result folded to a fresh MIN `lui` instead of copied from the proven-equal
 * `initial_level`. One bounded 300-second permuter run (~26k candidates) found
 * the source-meaningful identity split above but no zero. Guided autorules
 * sweeps of 80 and 160 targeted fence, boundary, field-store, temp, and type
 * candidates; focused follow-up lifetime/CFG probes reached this 33-byte
 * checkpoint but did not close the four remaining groups.
