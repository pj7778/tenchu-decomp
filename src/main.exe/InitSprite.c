 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * InitSprite (0x8004e9d8, 0x118 bytes) — zero a GsSPRITE, set its default
 * grey/full-scale look, then (when `image` is given) derive its pixel
 * geometry/tpage/UV window from a GsIMAGE. Twins: SetPolyXF4.c/AddXF4.c/
 * AddXG4.c/StartDrawing.c (same TU, all matched).
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - `tp = image->pmode & 3` reads only the LOW HALFWORD of the 4-byte
 *    pmode field (lhu at offset 0) — GsIMAGE's real layout (proven
 *    elsewhere, e.g. LoadTIM.c's full-word `im.pmode`) keeps pmode a
 *    u_long; this call site narrows via an explicit pointer cast rather
 *    than through the field, same idiom as a param-union's divergent
 *    access width (cookbook Expressions: reach it via an explicit offset
 *    cast off the SAME proven pointer).
 *  - `sh = 2 - tp` is a named local: it's read again AFTER the GetTPage
 *    call (for the `u` mask), so its live range crosses the call and it
 *    needs a callee-saved register — matches if declared once and reused
 *    for both the `w` shift and the `u` mask.
 *  - `image->px`/`image->py` are re-read (fresh loads) after the
 *    GetTPage call rather than cached, since the call clobbers the
 *    caller-saved copies (same "reload across an intervening call"
 *    shape as SetupSE.c's se->VABid).
 *  - `sprite->v = (u8)image->py` is a genuinely separate BYTE load
 *    (lbu) from the earlier full `lh` read of the same field for the
 *    GetTPage argument — different machine modes don't CSE (cookbook:
 *    DeleteConflict's ConflictObjects).
