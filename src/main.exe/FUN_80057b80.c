 * FUN_80057b80 (0x80057b80, 3796 bytes) — recursive quad/triangle subdivision
 * renderer of the DrawTMD handler family. Compiled-style C using the PsyQ
 * inline-GTE macros (gte_ldv3/gte_rtpt/gte_stsxy3/gte_stsz3) at two RTPT sites.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 8 of 3796 bytes differ. LENGTH IS EXACT.
 * (Round history: 759 -> 722 -> 619 -> 506 -> 494 -> 253 -> 208 -> 42 -> 36 -> 8.)
 *
 * The ENTIRE residual is ONE hunk: the two parameter-copy chains in the
 * prologue are emitted s0-first where the target emits s1-first.
 *      target: sw s1,28(sp); move s1,a1; sw s0,24(sp); move s0,a0
 *      ours:   sw s0,24(sp); move s0,a0; sw s1,28(sp); move s1,a1
 * Everything else — all 941 other instructions, every register, every delay
 * slot — is byte-identical. See "THE LAST 8 BYTES" at the bottom.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ROUND 6 — THE REUSABLE RULE (494 -> 8). Read this first.
 *
 * *** A STORE THAT MUST NOT BE FORWARDED BELONGS INSIDE BOTH if/else ARMS. ***
 *
 * Rounds 3-5 chased four "sites" (A/B/C/D-adj) and correctly identified the
 * mechanism — cse's store-to-load forwarding eats combine's `lh` fold at the
 * first read after a same-block store — but drew the WRONG conclusion from the
 * target's asm. All four fell to one source change.
 *
 * THE TRAP (this is the transferable part): at B/C/D-adj the FINAL asm shows
 * the store and its reload ADJACENT, IN ONE BLOCK, WITH NO LABEL BETWEEN THEM:
 *      sh v0,0x2C(s1)   /  lw v1,8(s0)  /  lh v0,0x2C(s1)
 * Round 5 read exactly that and concluded "a real CODE_LABEL would clear cse's
 * table, but there is no label here, so a label cannot be the answer". That
 * inference is invalid. **jump2's cross-jumping runs AFTER cse** and merges the
 * arms' common tail, so a label that existed at cse time is GONE by the time you
 * read the .s. The correct source is the store DUPLICATED into both arms:
 *      if (p0->x > p1->x) { ctx->xmax = p0->x; ctx->xmin = p1->x; }
 *      else               { ctx->xmax = p1->x; ctx->xmin = p0->x; }
 * At cse time the store is in each arm and the read is after the join, so
 * forwarding never fires and the read stays a real `lh`/`lw` that combine folds
 * from the movhi+ashift+ashiftrt. THEN jump2 cross-jumps the identical tail
 * (`lhu vX,12(vY); sh vX,44(ctx)`) into one shared copy, producing the exact
 * adjacency that looks impossible. Ghidra's `pMin`/`pCx`/`pCy` pointer temps are
 * an ARTIFACT of that late merge, not source.
 *
 * => GENERAL RULE: never infer a cse-time block structure from the final asm.
 *    cse1 runs before jump2; cross-jumping erases the labels cse saw. If a
 *    store/reload pair looks impossibly co-located, ask whether the arms were
 *    merged. The `do{}while(0)` fence is NOT the tool here (proven, round 5: a
 *    loop note is a SCHEDULING barrier, not an aliasing one, and does not block
 *    cse forwarding) — only a real join label does, and only arms supply one.
 *
 * VERIFY THIS WAY (fast, ~1s/variant, no Shake): extract the shape into a
 * standalone .c and run cc1-281 directly with the flags from tools/rtldump.py's
 * CC_FLAGS. The X box reduced to a 25-line testbed reproduced the sll/sra bug
 * and then the target's exact instruction sequence (including operand order) on
 * the first try. Do this BEFORE editing a 750-line draft.
 *
 * The four sites are LENGTH-NEUTRAL AS A PACKAGE, which is why rounds 3-5 could
 * not land them piecemeal: B and C each save 1 insn (sll/sra -> lh), D-adj gains
 * the missing `lw param_2[7]` reload (+1) => net -1, which exactly pays for
 * finding A's `proto = param_2 + 0x13` leaf base (+1). Net 0, length stays 3796.
 * A alone overflowed the carve (3800) and was unscoreable — that was the whole
 * reason it sat open for three rounds.
 *
 * ROUND 6's OTHER FINDINGS:
 *  - `proto` (finding A) CONFIRMED at the asm level: the leaf reads all three of
 *    its fields through a2 (`lhu 0xE(a2)`, `lhu 0x1A(a2)`, `lw 0x0(a2)`), and
 *    the four recursive blocks read 90/102 straight off param_2. Leaf-only.
 *  - `proto` must be assigned AFTER piVar13/local_30 (36 -> 8). The target
 *    computes `addiu t0,s0,136` right after the parameter moves and
 *    `addiu a2,s1,76` LAST, in the delay slot of the first beqz at 0x80057be0.
 *    With proto first, `move s8,t0` fills that slot instead.
 *  - gte_stsz3's THIRD pointer is INLINE, not hoisted (42 -> 36). The target
 *    computes the arg bases in ARGUMENT order (addiu 32/56/80), so
 *    `r2 = param_1 + 0x14;` as a preceding statement computed it FIRST.
 *    Spelling `gte_stsz3(param_1 + 8, param_1 + 0xe, param_1 + 0x14)` lets cse
 *    merge the two occurrences into one pseudo — one `addiu a0,s0,80` computed
 *    third and reused at the second call site, exactly as the target has it.
 *    NOTE the asymmetry: r2_00 (param_1 + 0x13) IS a real preceding statement
 *    (the target computes it early at 0x800584EC). Keep r2_00, inline r2.
 *  - The Z min/max fence round 5 added is now OBSOLETE (253 -> 208): it was
 *    buying a barrier the pre-restructure shape needed, at +4 weighted refs on
 *    param_2. Removing it also makes the two Z blocks symmetric.
 *  - Round 3's finding 1 ("local_30 must NOT be copied from piVar13") is now
 *    MOOT: post-restructure, `local_30 = piVar13;` and `piVar13 = local_30;`
 *    and two independent `param_1 + 0x22` all give byte-identical output (8).
 *    The conflict graph it was measured on no longer exists.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO MEASUREMENT HAZARDS THAT COST THIS ROUND REAL TIME — read before you
 * count anything in a .s.
 *
 * 1. maspsx's DEBUG comment lines QUOTE instructions. `.shake/processed/.../
 *    X.s` contains lines like
 *        nop # DEBUG: Reuse of '$2'. 'sh	$2,44($16)' does not use $at
 *    A naive `grep -c 'sh.*44($16)'` counts the comment as a real store. That
 *    manufactured a phantom "+3 surplus param_2 refs" and a whole false theory
 *    that the arms were NOT being cross-jumped. Strip every line's first '#'
 *    to end-of-line with sed before counting — and NOT with `grep -v '^#'`,
 *    because these lines start with `nop`, not with '#'.
 * 2. The GTE macros emit `swc2 $17, 0($4)` etc. `$17` there is COP2 data
 *    register 17, NOT $s1. Any `$17` count in a gte.h function is inflated by
 *    the swc2/lwc2 lines. Discount them.
 *   With both applied, our param_1/param_2 asm mention counts are 76/107 —
 *   EXACTLY the target's. That is the proof the source structure is right and
 *   only the hard-register assignment ever differed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE REGISTER ALLOCATION (still true, still load-bearing).
 *
 * cc1 2.8.1 global.c allocno_compare:
 *     pri = (floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length) * 10000 * size
 * sorted priority-descending, ties to the LOWER allocno. MIPS defines no
 * REG_ALLOC_ORDER, so find_reg takes the first free callee-saved reg = $s0.
 * prune_preferences() strips a0/a1 copy preferences from anything crossing a
 * call, so NOTHING biases this but the sort. flow.c: reg_n_refs is `+= loop_depth`
 * at each ref (the whole fence lever); reg_live_length accumulates over
 * insns-where-live, NOT a first-use..last-use span. Use tools/regalloc.py
 * --compare 80 81; it prints the exact "needs +N weighted ref(s)".
 *
 * THE FENCE (scaffolding, load-bearing, honest about it): a TRIPLE `do{}while(0)`
 * (depth 4) around the LEAF vertex copies. param_1 must outrank param_2 for $s0.
 * Post-restructure the gap was only +1 weighted ref (p80 4421 vs p81 4453); the
 * triple fence takes p80 74 -> 110 refs and wins with margin. Zero collateral —
 * s2..s8 dispositions and every other pseudo are unchanged.
 *   - WHY THE LEAF: histogram BOTH rivals. Net (param_1 - param_2) source
 *     mentions per region: Z block -3, X box -1, Y box -1, leaf OT -12,
 *     recursive -31, midpoints +26, LEAF VERTEX COPIES +12. Only the last two
 *     have param_1 > param_2, and the midpoints are where p124..p128 live (every
 *     fence round 4 tried there permuted s2-s7 — it sited the fence ON TOP of
 *     the collateral). The leaf is the OTHER ARM of the same if/else, so it
 *     cannot touch them.
 *   - THE BOUNDARY IS LOAD-BEARING: `prim = param_2[5]` must stay INSIDE with
 *     its 12 uses. Outside, the loop-begin note cuts the definition from the
 *     uses and param_2[5] is reloaded (+1). General rule: put a fence's boundary
 *     where no value defined just outside is used just inside.
 *
 * Ghidra's mega-pseudos are the other half of the allocation (worth 140 bytes):
 * it reuses ONE variable for many unrelated jobs; each is ONE pseudo and gets ONE
 * hard register for ALL fragments, so a conflict anywhere exiles every use.
 * iVar3 did ~12 jobs and landed in $a3 with 70 mentions where the target's $a3
 * has 5. Split per-site/per-block. Find it by histogramming register mentions:
 * a caller-saved register with 70 mentions is a mega-pseudo; no real source has
 * one. Also load-bearing: each midpoint block writes its fields THROUGH its own
 * SVECTOR pointer (r0/r1_00/r2_01/r1/r2_02); and `sVar1` is a SIGNED short while
 * `uVar2` is u16 — DIFFERENT modes, so cc1 emits both `lh` and `lhu` and does not
 * CSE them (declaring sVar1 as u16 collapses them and costs 2 insns).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE LAST 8 BYTES — diagnosed to the exact gcc decision; DO NOT re-walk.
 *
 * The 4 insns are the two parameter-copy chains, order-swapped. Diagnosis from
 * the .sched2 dump (tools/rtldump.py FUN_80057b80 --draft --pass sched):
 *   - insn 4 = `move s0,a0` (param_1), insn 6 = `move s1,a1` (param_2). Both
 *     carry `priority = 1` (a reg move has latency 1, so nothing propagates a
 *     longer chain into them; the whole prologue is priority 1).
 *   - gcc 2.8.1 sched.c rank_for_schedule: priority first, then the
 *     dependent-class test, then `INSN_LUID (tmp) - INSN_LUID (tmp2)` — the
 *     ORIGINAL insn order, "to make the sort stable".
 *   - With priorities tied, LUID decides, and LUID follows assign_parms, i.e.
 *     the PARAMETER LIST ORDER: `move s0,a0` (a0 = first parameter) always sorts
 *     ahead of `move s1,a1`. The scheduler then emits 1998, 2018(sw s0),
 *     4(move s0), 2016(sw s1), 6(move s1) — our exact output.
 *   The target's order requires insn 6 to be emitted first, i.e. either
 *   PRIORITY(4) > PRIORITY(6) (nothing in the first block supplies that: s1's
 *   only first-block use is `addiu a2,s1,0x4C`) or LUID(6) < LUID(4) (which
 *   would mean param_2's copy precedes param_1's in the RTL — not reachable from
 *   a (param_1, param_2, param_3) signature).
 *
 * TRIED AND MEASURED THIS ROUND, ALL STILL 8 (do not repeat):
 *   piVar13/local_30/proto in all 6 statement orders (proto first: 36;
 *   piVar13,proto,local_30: LENGTH MISMATCH 3788; local_30,proto,piVar13: 32);
 *   `local_30 = piVar13;` and `piVar13 = local_30;` copy forms: both 8.
 * NEXT IDEA (untested): the prologue save order itself. Our RTL numbers the
 * saves 2016 (s1, at 28) BEFORE 2018 (s0, at 24) — i.e. save_restore_insns emits
 * them DESCENDING by regno, which is already the target's emitted order. Only the
 * anti-dependence to insn 4 pulls 2018 forward. Something that raises insn 6's
 * priority above insn 4's — a first-block param_2 use with a load-use hazard —
 * would flip it. Worth checking whether param_3 (`sw a2,72(sp)`) or the
 * `*param_2 == param_3` compare belongs earlier than Ghidra placed it.
 *
 * DO NOT RE-RUN / RE-DERIVE (all spent, all negative):
 *   - autorules (46 candidates, no win); the permuter (refuses gte.h functions
 *     outright — its parser cannot read inline asm).
 *   - the ctx alias (`int *ctx = param_2;` then `ctx[7] = ...`): it DOES produce
 *     the reload, but the store then uses ctx's register (`sw v0,28(a1)`) where
 *     the target uses param_2's. Superseded entirely by the arms rule above.
 *   - "equalise the priorities, ties break to the lower allocno": arithmetically
 *     empty here, no N lands on the tie.
 *   - "regalloc.py reads the wrong dump": it does not. Its .lreg live_length
 *     scores 0 violations / 53 pairs against the real post-qsort order printed by
 *     `;; N regs to allocate:`; the .flow numbers score 15. live_length is simply
 *     not bounded by the instruction count.
 *   - a fence on the Z block / the second Z min/max / site B: all measured, all
 *     negative (the second Z min/max BREAKS the flip: 494 -> 574).
 *
 * The `lwc2; nop; nop; RTPT` shape at both command sites (0x80058320, 0x80058548)
 * is confirmed from the raw image bytes, so the nop-carrying `gte_rtpt()` is
 * correct here (this is a COMPILED caller — docs/gte-policy.md).
 *
 * Build the draft with `NON_MATCHING=FUN_80057b80 ./Build`. Rebuild it BEFORE
 * every `matchdiff.py -n` — a plain `./Build check` relinks the INCLUDE_ASM stub
 * and matchdiff will (correctly) refuse to score it.
