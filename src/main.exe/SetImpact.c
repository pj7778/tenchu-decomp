/*
 * Matching notes (all verified against the original bytes):
 *  - Unlike SetFrame/SetSplash/SetBleed's hand-rolled `goto loop;`, this
 *    EffectSlot[200] search is a REAL `do { ... } while (count < 200);`
 *    with `ef = &dmy;` placed AFTER the loop (fallthrough on exhaustion),
 *    not a while(1)+break with `ef = &dmy;` inside the loop body. The
 *    target's give-up path has a tell-tale `addiu idx,idx,1` / `addiu
 *    idx,idx,-1` pair: reorg steals the loop head's `idx = idx + 1` into
 *    the backjump's delay slot (retargeting the branch to skip it) and
 *    patches the fallthrough (loop-exhausted) path with a compensating
 *    decrement — the "wrap-around search loop" idiom (cookbook, Loops),
 *    which only appears with a genuine bottom-tested do-while (loop
 *    notes), not the hand-rolled goto shape. Since &dmy here is used
 *    strictly AFTER the loop (not on a conditional path INSIDE it), a
 *    real loop doesn't risk loop.c hoisting its address either — the
 *    hoisting hazard that forced SetFrame/SetSplash/SetBleed's goto shape
 *    doesn't apply once `ef = &dmy;` moves outside the loop body.
 *  - rand()'s result (`spd`), and the two field constants `scale`/`rotate`
 *    (0x808080 each), are all named locals assigned BEFORE the loop and
 *    held live across the whole search (no calls run inside it) — not
 *    literals at their point of use. All three floated only after the
 *    magic-multiply div-by-90 sequence for `spd` was written FIRST in
 *    source (immediately after `r = rand();`), then `scale`/`rotate`;
 *    the compiler's scheduler places their independent lui/ori pairs
 *    ahead of the still-latency-bound `mult`/`mfhi` chain regardless, so
 *    getting the register (t1/t2/t3) assignment right needed this order,
 *    not just declaring them anywhere before the loop.
 *  - Field-fill order/register habits match FUN_8003944c's "spawn a
 *    blood-family effect exactly as told" shape: the offset-zero-relative-
 *    to-ef `hint` store goes through a fresh recast (fp isn't computed
 *    yet), `fp = &ef->param.blood;` is cached right after for every field
 *    from `px` on, and only the `pos->vz` capture is delayed to the very
 *    end (stored as `py` last) — every other field, including the two
 *    0x808080 literals, stores immediately in offset order (pz, vy, vz,
 *    scale, rotate, time, vx, unk22, bright, mode).
