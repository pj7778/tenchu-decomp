/*
 * GetAttackDBID (0x8002a8ec, 0x8c bytes) — resolves the character's current
 * motion to a row index into the BattleDB attack-pattern table: linear-search
 * BattleDB[].mid for a match against GetMotionID(character's
 * something_about_current_animation, mid), sentinel-terminated by
 * mid == -1. Returns the matching row's index, or (no match before the
 * sentinel) the sentinel's own index.
 *
 * Plain `while (BattleDB[i].mid != -1) { if (match) break; i++; }` — jump.c's
 * duplicate_loop_exit_test copies the condition to the entry using the
 * provable i==0 (a literal offset-0 access, no index register), and again at
 * the loop bottom with the updated i (see the cookbook's bottom-test
 * do-while shape). `i` is s16: cc1 folds its sign-extend-then-scale-by-
 * sizeof(BattleDBEntry)==0x10 into one `sll 16/sra 12` pair instead of a
 * separate extend + `sll 4`.
