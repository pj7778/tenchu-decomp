 *     PADCMD.C:333, 22 src lines, frame 0 bytes, saved-reg mask 0x00000000 (DEMO build -- see below)

 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     param $t0       struct PADtype * pad

 *     reg   $a2       short i

/*
 * STATUS: MATCHED — exact retail bytes (292 bytes, 73 instructions).
 *
 * GetCommand (0x8001af14) — checks pad->stream[] (the recent-input ring,
 * newest first) against every entry in the global Command table (same
 * NULL-terminated `u16 *` table as SetCommand.c: entry[0] = command id,
 * entry[1..] = a 0xFFFF-terminated button-sequence pattern). The first
 * entry whose pattern is a prefix of pad->stream[] wins: pad->stream[] is
 * shifted down by one (dropping the oldest, stream[0] cleared for the next
 * frame) and entry[0] is returned. Returns 0 if no entry matches.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - Outer loop is a plain rotated `for (i = 0; Command[i] != 0; i++)` —
 *    jump.c elides the front test (i=0 provably true) and fuses the
 *    increment into the "go check the next entry" continuation, matching
 *    the asm computing `i+1` only as part of testing `Command[i+1]`.
 *  - Inner matching is a natural `for (j = 0; cmd[j] != 0xFFFF; j++)`.
 *    That source form makes cc1 keep the initial sentinel test in the loop
 *    preheader and materialize a separate 0xFFFF carrier for the backedge;
 *    the resulting live ranges place `cmd`, `i`, and `pad` in the registers
 *    recorded by PSX.SYM. Spelling this as an explicit guard plus do-while
 *    merges the two sentinel identities and displaces those registers.
 *  - The shift loop is Ghidra's literal do-while (`j = 3; do {
 *    pad->stream[j] = pad->stream[j-1]; j--; } while (j > 0);`), not a
 *    `for` — matches the single post-decrement bottom test with no
 *    redundant front check.
 *  - The final return re-derives `Command[i]` fresh (`*(short *)Command[i]`)
 *    rather than reusing an `entry` variable — the asm reloads it by index
 *    at the return, not from a cached pointer.
