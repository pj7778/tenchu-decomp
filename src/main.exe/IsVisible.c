 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 9 of 520 bytes differ; RIGHT LENGTH (130
 * instructions both sides, confirmed by asmdiff --structural: zero
 * inserts/deletes, only register-name replacements in one block). The
 * residual is a 3-way rotation of which callee-saved register ($s0/$s1/$s2)
 * ends up holding `q2` (the third eager division's quotient), `iVar4` (the
 * second), and `fail` — a pure global-alloc tie: `tools/regalloc.py` shows
 * no copy-chain pinning any of the three to a specific hard register.
 * `tools/permute.py` ran ~42000 iterations (--stop-on-zero, -j4, ~8 min
 * bounded) without finding a byte-exact candidate; its best-scoring
 * candidates were either identical modulo unreachable dead code (a
 * `do{}while(0)` injected after a `return`) or otherwise did not reduce the
 * real `matchdiff` byte count — re-verified per the cookbook's warning that
 * the permuter's own score isn't raw bytes.
 *
 * Root-caused precisely via `tools/rtldump.py --pass lreg` (global.c's
 * `allocno_compare` formula, cookbook's "pure callee-saved SWAP residual"
 * section, extended here to 3 allocnos): `priority = floor_log2(refs) *
 * refs / live_length`, and the HIGHEST-priority allocno gets first pick of
 * the free callee-saved regs in ascending order ($s0, then $s1, then $s2).
 * The three pseudos' raw stats in this draft: `fail` refs=4 life=22 ->
 * floor_log2(4)*4/22 = 0.364; `q2` refs=2 life=6 -> floor_log2(2)*2/6 =
 * 0.333; `iVar4` refs=3 life=17 -> floor_log2(3)*3/17 = 0.176. Assigned in
 * DESCENDING priority order that's exactly `fail`(->$s0) > `q2`(->$s1) >
 * `iVar4`(->$s2) — our current (wrong) result. The target needs `q2` >
 * `iVar4` > `fail`; since `q2` already outranks `iVar4` (0.333 > 0.176),
 * ONLY `fail`'s priority needs to drop below 0.176 — either by roughly
 * DOUBLING its live_length (22 -> 46+, i.e. keeping it live across
 * substantially more of the function than it naturally is) or by dropping
 * its refs from 4 to 3 (floor_log2(3)*3/22 = 0.136, which would work).
 * Both levers were tried and rejected: moving the `fail = 0;` statement
 * earlier (to extend its apparent live range across all three divisions)
 * produced BYTE-IDENTICAL output — confirmed via a fresh `rtldump --pass
 * lreg` that pseudo 94's reported live_length stayed at exactly 22 insns
 * regardless of source position, meaning cc1 computes life_length from the
 * REACHING-DEFINITION dataflow, not textual statement order (a "move the
 * ballast statement" trick, unlike SoundEx's, does not apply here). Cutting
 * `fail`'s ref count from 4 to 3 would require merging the two `fail = 1;`
 * assignment sites (one per branch) into one shared, `goto`-reached block —
 * but that shared block would then be the immediate predecessor of
 * `return !fail;`, and per this file's OWN already-solved constant-fold
 * pitfall (documented below: an assignment immediately preceding a `return`
 * of an expression provably constant AT THAT POINT gets folded, 3
 * instructions shorter), merging the two sites this way would trigger
 * EXACTLY that fold and regress the byte count that took real effort to
 * fix. So the one lever big enough to move this tie is foreclosed by a
 * DIFFERENT already-matched requirement in the SAME function — this is a
 * genuine sub-C-level tie with a quantified, dump-verified mechanism, not a
 * bare "permuter-immune" guess. Parked per the sub-C-level early-stop.
 *
 * IsVisible (0x8003b604, 0x208 bytes) — same TU as GetCenterAndSize.c/
 * leFindEnemy.c (WORLD.C): a cheap frustum-ish visibility test for a
 * construction billboard/effect at world (x,y,z): first a fast axis-aligned
 * box reject against the GTE's cached view position (raw PSX scratchpad RAM
 * @0x1F800000, still holding the last ApplyRotMatrix/perspective-transform
 * inputs from whatever earlier GTE call populated it), then a real
 * perspective test (rotate the delta into view space via ApplyRotMatrix,
 * then compare the projected x/y against a screen-space rectangle scaled by
 * `s`, the object's on-screen half-size).
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - `view` (the `0x1F800038`-based scratchpad read) is a genuine CACHED
 *    POINTER kept live in a callee-saved register ACROSS the three `abs()`
 *    calls — matching the "cached pointer across calls" rule — not three
 *    independent raw-literal dereferences. `scratch` (`0x1F800000`, used
 *    after ApplyRotMatrix) gets the SAME treatment for its own 3 reads, but
 *    is a SEPARATE raw literal — cc1 never merges the two hardcoded
 *    constants even though both sit in PSX scratchpad RAM.
 *  - All THREE divisions by `iVar1` (a runtime value, not a constant) are
 *    computed EAGERLY, back-to-back, into named temporaries (`q0`, `iVar4`,
 *    `q2`) — BEFORE either `abs()` call that consumes them. Ghidra's own
 *    rendering shows the third division folded inline into the second
 *    `abs()` call's argument (`abs(iVar3/iVar1)`), which is an SSA/statement-
 *    order artifact: the raw asm computes all three quotients up front
 *    (sharing the one divisor register across all three `div`s before a
 *    call could clobber it), then does the two `abs()` calls.
 *  - The three range guards are all flat guard-clause early returns
 *    (`if (!(cond)) return 0;`) — nesting the second/third (Ghidra's own
 *    literal `if (a) { if (b) {...} }` rendering) makes zero byte difference
 *    here, so the flat form is kept for readability.
 *  - The final success/failure test is a `fail` flag (0=ok), NOT a plain
 *    `if (cond) return 1; return 0;` — cc1 compiles the return as `!fail`
 *    (an `xori`), and importantly the FIRST failing branch does NOT return
 *    early; both branches converge on ONE shared `return !fail;` at the
 *    bottom. Returning immediately after `fail = 1;` on the first branch
 *    lets cc1 constant-fold `!1` to a literal 0 there, which is 3
 *    instructions shorter than the target (it doesn't fold, because the
 *    real source funnels both branches through one common return).
 *  - The three divisions need ASPSX's guarded div expansion — this file is
 *    in Build.hs's `maspsxGpExterns` `extra`/`--expand-div` list (and
 *    permute.py's MASPSX_EXTRA); no explicit `trap()` calls belong in the C,
 *    maspsx inserts the break-7/break-6 guards around a plain `/`
 *    automatically.
