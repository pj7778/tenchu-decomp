/*
 * DrawOrnament (0x800186d4, 0x44 bytes) — like UpdateCoordinate/DrawBG's
 * sibling in this same TU: builds the local screen matrix for an ornament's
 * GsCOORDINATE2 (GsGetLs + GsSetLsMatrix, same pair GetAbsolutePosition uses
 * for the world variant GsGetLw), then draws its GsDOBJ2 via DrawTMD into the
 * global ordering table OTablePt, and always reports success (1).
 *
 * OrnamentType (Ghidra: `{ GsCOORDINATE2 locate; GsDOBJ2 object; }`) isn't
 * shared via item.h yet; declared locally with just the two accessed fields,
 * same convention as UpdateOrnament.c (locate@0, object right after it@0x50
 * — GsCOORDINATE2 is proven 0x50 bytes: flg(4)+coord(0x20)+workm(0x20)+
 * param/super/sub(4 each) = 0x50).
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - m2c undercounts GsGetLs's call: `objp` (a0) is carried in live from the
 *    caller and never reassigned before the jal, so m2c's basic-block-local
 *    view misses it — Ghidra's 2-arg rendering (&objp->locate, &m) is the
 *    real call (same undercount pattern as DrawBG's FUN_80063b94).
 *  - OTablePt is %gp_rel in this TU, same as DrawBG (tools/gpsyms.py
 *    --write; Build.hs maspsxGpExterns + permute.py GP_EXTERNS both list
 *    DrawOrnament now).
