 *     HUMAN.C:408, 24 src lines, frame 48 bytes, saved-reg mask 0x807f0000 (DEMO build -- see below)
 *
 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * GetNearestHumanoid (0x80029864) returns the nearest other live, visible,
 * type-filtered Humanoid within `distance`, or 0. It searches only while the
 * input Humanoid is at ground level (map.height == 0). The type/attribute
 * mask tests intentionally use unsigned halfword loads; status/life use
 * signed halfword loads, matching their comparisons and item.h declarations.
 *
 * The height check MUST be an early-return guard clause, not an `if (height
 * == 0) { for (...) }` wrapper, even though both spell the same behaviour and
 * both fold to the same `bnez -> epilogue` branch. cc1's post-reload
 * `reload_cse_regs` (toplev.c:3501, after .greg, before sched2) rewrites a
 * constant SET_SRC into a copy from the first hard register (scanning regno 0
 * upward) already recorded as holding that value -- unconditionally; there is
 * no cost comparison, and $zero never qualifies because no insn ever sets it.
 * With the wrapper form nothing separates `best = 0` (s4) from the loop's
 * `i = 0`, so s4 is still recorded as 0 and the preheader degrades to
 * `move s2,s4`. reload_cse_regs forgets every register value at a CODE_LABEL,
 * and the early return's `if_false` label lands exactly between the two
 * zeroes, so s4 is forgotten and `i = 0` stays `move s2,zero` as in the
 * target. jump2 cross-jumping then merges the two identical `return best`
 * tails, which is why the final asm is otherwise identical.
 *
 * The indexed `for` is intentional: cc1 strength-reduces HumanGroup[i] to
 * the target's s1 walking pointer while keeping i in s2. `__builtin_abs`
 * keeps each absolute value as one RTL operation until reorg, which lets the
 * first dx multiply issue before dz is formed and hides both MULT hazards.
 * Reusing dx as the 0x90 type-mask threshold gives that first abs result the
 * target's distinct v1 output lifetime; dx is overwritten before its
 * distance use. Flattening the guard loses that lifetime and coalesces the
 * abs input/output in v0.
