 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 214 of 628 bytes differ, down from 451; the extent
 * remains exact at 628 bytes / 157 instructions and the fuzzy score improved
 * from 57.32 to 84.08. The target and candidate now both use a 0xA8-byte
 * frame with $s0-$s7 (the old draft unnecessarily consumed $s8). Their
 * physical CFG counts also agree for conditional branches (15/15), calls
 * (9/9), returns (1/1), and unconditional jumps (2/2).
 * `asmdiff -n --structural` reports 38 length-changing lines in 13 displayed
 * blocks (52 raw aligned lines in 23 blocks), so the residual is not being
 * misreported as a pure register tie.
 *
 * The first search now retains a separate table base while its walker advances;
 * expressing the next-row sentinel as the loop condition recovers retail's
 * load/branch shape without rematerializing the base after the loop.  The map
 * argument is loaded directly into a0, and an explicit high/low type tail plus
 * a separately captured high attribute recovers the target's total CFG.  The
 * captured attribute folds two high-path instructions; a safe volatile read of
 * the already-written point[0] field supplies the one-instruction exact-extent
 * counterweight without changing the value-level behavior.
 *
 * The main remaining cascade starts in the HumanData searches: target
 * materializes the table base and carries the found row/model as
 * $s0/$s2, then explicitly rotates roles before the filename-sharing scan;
 * this draft carries them as $s1/$s2. That row/base rotation feeds the second
 * search, where the draft preserves the -1 sentinel in $s3 instead of
 * rematerializing it into $v0 after strcmp. An explicit filename-row alias
 * recovered the target's $s0->$s1 rotation but shifted the whole call region
 * and scored 335 linked bytes; a fully target-shaped tail is one instruction
 * long because the original carve excludes the return delay slot. Keep those
 * forms as structural evidence, not checkpoints. The current exact 214-byte
 * form is authoritative.
 *
 * BreedLife (0x8002a018, 0x278 bytes) — spawns a new Humanoid of `type` at
 * ground position (x,z) with yaw `r`: resolves `type` to its HumanData[]
 * row (linear search, sentinel .type==-1), loads the row's .MAD model file
 * on first use (and patches every OTHER HumanData row sharing that same
 * filename to point at the freshly-loaded model too — a cache shared by
 * name, not by index), then CreateHumanoid's the instance and positions it
 * (point[]/model->locate.coord.t[] snap Y to GetAreaMapLevel's terrain
 * height), before applying two type-range special cases (ninja-dog leash
 * flag; auto-equip a weapon for player-ish/low types; a "guard" attribute
 * bit for a high type range).
 *
 * The demo's PSX.SYM register roles for the 4 register params ($s4=type,
 * $s5=x, $s7=y, $s6=z) do NOT match retail's actual assignment (verified
 * against the raw `.s`: prologue copies a1->s7(x), a2->s6(y), a3->s4(z),
 * a0->s5(type)) — just the parameter ORDER/TYPES carry over, not which
 * register each lands in; the C source doesn't need to name registers.
 *
 * splat/reverse.py's carve splits this one function into TWO INCLUDE_ASM
 * pieces (`BreedLife` + `create_character__override__prt_...`) — that
 * second symbol is a Ghidra call-site prototype-override marker sitting
 * inside this function's own byte range, NOT a second function (see
 * CVAsetup.c's `reload_animations__override__` sibling case). One `BreedLife`
 * definition below produces both pieces.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - Ghidra renders the not-found path as a hard stop ("WARNING: Subroutine
 *    does not return" after SystemOut), but the raw `.s` proves SystemOut is
 *    NOT noreturn here: execution falls straight through afterward into the
 *    SAME code the success path reaches (recomputing `&HumanData[idx]` and
 *    continuing to index it, model and all, even though idx's row is the
 *    sentinel). This is the cookbook's "guard clause with no second return
 *    is a plain if" family taken to its limit — there is no early return at
 *    all here, just a diagnostic call with no effect on control flow. Two
 *    INDEPENDENT tests reach the one `SystemOut` call site: the initial
 *    `HumanData[0].type == -1` (empty table) skips the search loop
 *    entirely via a direct branch, and the search loop's own post-loop
 *    `HumanData[idx].type == -1` (not found) falls into the same call —
 *    spelled as two `if (cond) goto callit;` tests sharing one label
 *    (the two-independent-goto-into-one-label family), not a nested
 *    if/return.
 *  - The search loop is a genuine walking-pointer `do { ... } while`, not an
 *    index-based search (unlike SetupCharacterParameter's sibling loop in
 *    the same TU): the raw `.s` increments a real HumanDataType* by 0x18
 *    every iteration (Ghidra's own `pHVar5 = pHVar5 + 1;` is literal, not
 *    an SSA artifact here). The `idx` counter only increments on iterations
 *    that DON'T break, so it deliberately diverges from the pointer's own
 *    position — the post-loop code recomputes `&HumanData[idx]` from `idx`
 *    via the `*24` strength reduction (`idx*3<<3`), it does NOT reuse the
 *    walking pointer's final value (confirmed: no register carries the
 *    pointer out of the loop).
 *  - `human->model->locate.coord.t[N]`/`.rotate.vy` are each written via a
 *    FRESH re-dereference of `human->model` (5 separate `lw`s at the same
 *    +0x58 offset, one per access, including across the intervening
 *    `GetAreaMapLevel`/`UpdateCoordinate` calls) — Ghidra's own `pMVar4 =
 *    human->model;` cache is an SSA artifact for exactly ONE of the five
 *    accesses and reproduces nothing extra if written literally each time
 *    instead (CVArun/vrealloc's "target reloads a fresh field dereference"
 *    family).
 *  - `GlobalAreaMap` is read into a temp BEFORE the point[]/coord.t[0]
 *    stores that don't need it, matching Ghidra's own `puVar7 =
 *    GlobalAreaMap;` position — read early, consumed only much later at the
 *    `GetAreaMapLevel` call.
 *  - `GetAreaMapLevel`'s real prototype (AddItem2.c) takes 5 args
 *    (map,x,y,z,mode); Ghidra's rendering here drops the trailing `z,1`
 *    (the m2c/Ghidra call-arg-undercount family) — the raw `.s` sets up
 *    a3=z and a stack mode=1 that are never otherwise touched, so the real
 *    call is `GetAreaMapLevel(map, x, y, z, 1)`.
 *  - The two type-range special cases are a plain `if (type<0x8b) {...}
 *    else if (type<0xa8 && 0xa5<type) {...}` — the raw `.s` tests `type<0x8b`
 *    FIRST and branches to the nested block on true, matching this polarity
 *    directly (no De Morgan inversion needed here, unlike several other
 *    guard-clause functions in this TU family).
