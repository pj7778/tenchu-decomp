 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * valloc (0x8001656c, 0x1CC bytes) — the free-list allocator's core routine.
 * Same TU as vinit.c/vfree.c/vcalloc.c/vgetmaxsize.c/vgetfreesize.c
 * (VALLOC.C). Lazily self-initializes the pool the way vinit(0,0) would,
 * rounds the request up to words, then walks the free list for the first
 * fit: exact-or-near (slack < 0x13 words) is marked in-use whole, bigger is
 * split (the tail becomes a fresh free block). On failure it walks the list
 * twice more (max free block, total free) to format the fatal "OUT OF
 * MEMORY" diagnostic for SystemOut, then returns the (NULL) cursor.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - THE $s1 MECHANISM (this was the previous session's 2-instruction
 *    residual): the search cursor `vmpt` is ALSO the return value, and the
 *    function's very last statement is `return vmpt;` — AFTER the sprintf/
 *    SystemOut calls (the target's `addu $v0,$s1,$zero` at 0x80016720).
 *    That final use keeps vmpt live across both calls, which is the entire
 *    reason cc1 gives it callee-saved $s1 (and the extra sw/lw pair). The
 *    early exit is `if (vmpt) goto done;` to the shared `done: return
 *    vmpt;` — that compiles to the target's 2-insn `bnez $s1,epilogue`
 *    with `move $v0,$s1` in the delay slot; a literal early `return vmpt;`
 *    instead compiles branch-AROUND (beqz + j + nop, 2 insns long). A draft
 *    that ends at SystemOut() has no call-crossing use, so the cursor lands
 *    caller-saved and the whole loop's registers cascade off-target.
 *  - THE SPLIT-ARM FRESH RELOADS (cse.c follow-jumps, root-caused in the
 *    gcc-2.8.1 sources): the split arm must reload `vhp->size`/`vhp->next`
 *    fresh (lw/subu/addiu -2 through the $a0 copy) even though the tests
 *    just loaded *vmpt. cse's path-following (cse_end_of_basic_block)
 *    follows a conditional branch's taken edge whenever the target label
 *    has NUSES==1 and is preceded by a BARRIER — which the natural
 *    if/else+break shape always satisfies, so cse merges the split arm's
 *    loads with the tests' values (and a post-cse jump_optimize then also
 *    inverts the branch and moves the near-fit arm to the function end).
 *    The scan is blocked by a NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END sitting between that
 *    barrier and the label: hence the dummy do{}while(0) around the
 *    near-fit arm, whose loop notes land exactly there. With the follow
 *    blocked, the split arm compiles as its own fresh basic block —
 *    byte-exact, including the whole loop's register assignment.
 *  - Stack layout: the split-tmp `vh` is the OUTER declaration (sp+0x18),
 *    the self-init `vh` is a nested-block shadow inside the `if` (sp+0x20),
 *    and `str` lives in a later nested block (sp+0x28) — matching PSX.SYM's
 *    two `vh` scopes at sp+24/sp+32 and cc1's in-encounter-order slot
 *    assignment.
 *  - The loop reads its tests through `vmpt` (lw 0($s1)) but takes a copy
 *    `vhp = (PoolBlock *)vmpt;` at loop top ($a0, scheduled into the first
 *    branch's delay slot): the split arm's loads/stores and the advance
 *    (`vmpt = vhp->next`) go through the copy.
 *  - `maxsize <<= 2;` is a real source statement between the two tail loops
 *    (after `freesize = 0;`): its `sll` is what reorg steals into the second
 *    loop guard's delay slot; sprintf then receives `maxsize` raw.
 *  - The self-init branch duplicates vinit.c's `size == 0` arm literally
 *    (pool = 0x800DC000; vh.size = 0x47ffe; vh.next = 0) — no call, cc1
 *    2.8.1 does not inline. VMEM_DEFAULT_POOL/VMEM_DEFAULT_CAPACITY retain that
 *    human-looking exact source.  For the normal link, a bounded assembly
 *    transform changes only those LUI/ORI pairs to standard symbolic
 *    LUI/ADDIU pairs, preserving this function's exact 0x1cc-byte schedule.
 *    Image growth can then move the pool base and derive its smaller capacity;
 *    tools/reloc_c_literals.py gates the transform and relocation counts.
 *  - The request rounding is `if (size & 3) size += 4;` (NOT `(size+3)&~3`)
 *    — read off the raw immediate; keep the odd shape.
 *  - Both whole-struct stores (`*virtual_memory_pool = vh;`, `*(PoolBlock *)
 *    vmpt = vh;`) are aggregate assignments: two field stores to the stack
 *    slot, then the $t1/$t2 reload+store block copy (vinit.c's idiom).
