 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     param $a1       struct tag_EffectSlot * ef
 *     reg   $a2       struct ExplosionType * param
 *     reg   $s0       struct Sprite3D * spr

 * MATCH.
 *
 * DrawHinoko advances the spark/explosion state, integrates its velocity,
 * copies the result to sprBomb[2], and draws it. `ef->param` is the
 * ExplosionType union member: vec@0x0, pos@0x8, rotate@0x18, scale@0x1c,
 * time@0x20, and mode@0x21.
 *
 * After normalizing relocated global addresses, the demo implementation is
 * instruction-identical to retail apart from its epilogue. For this function,
 * PSX.SYM's line events map to the demo executable at +0x20 and form a useful
 * source-order oracle: after the switch the original statements are time,
 * vertical acceleration, scale, then position x/y/z. The old parked
 * draft instead preloaded z/x/y into invented scalar locals; that changed
 * sched1's quantity graph and created the supposed 18-byte allocation floor.
 * The ordinary compound assignments below reproduce the target allocation.
 *
 * Two other carriers are unnecessary. GCC CSEs the two direct `time` reads in
 * case 1 into the target's single lbu. A direct rotation assignment written
 * before the RGB stores keeps its load there and schedules its store into
 * UpdateCoordinate's delay slot. The result uses exactly PSX.SYM's original
 * locals: param, spr, and alfa.
