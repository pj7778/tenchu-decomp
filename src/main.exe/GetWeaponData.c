/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 24 of 500 bytes differ (asmdiff: 35 differing
 * lines in 16 blocks, function 1 instruction too long: 126 vs 125). Every
 * block/branch/instruction is structurally right (loop shapes, dispatch,
 * field offsets, calls all confirmed against the raw .s); the residual is
 * a pure register-allocation tie in the FIRST (WeaponDB) search: the
 * target keeps the loop counter `i` in one register and the WeaponDB base
 * address in another (a1) for the whole loop with no extra move, while
 * this draft's cc1 invocation puts the freshly-materialised WeaponDB base
 * in the SAME register cc1 also wants for `i`'s next value, forcing an
 * extra `move` to evacuate it first. Tried: swapping `i`/`w` declaration
 * order (no effect — pure local order doesn't reach this tie), moving the
 * `w = (short)wep` narrowing statement before/after the first search
 * (moving it later made things WORSE, 127 vs 125 — an unrelated `lw`
 * of the raw stack int got scheduled early instead of the intended `lhu`
 * narrowing read). `tools/autorules.py` found no improving edit (8
 * candidates, all net negative). One bounded `tools/permute.py` run
 * (~5 min, -j4, several hundred iterations across many candidates)
 * bottomed out at score 660 — never near 0 — so this is parked per the
 * cookbook's sub-C-level early-stop, not chased further.

/*
 * GetWeaponData (0x8002a290, 0x1f4 bytes) — two independent sentinel-
 * terminated linear searches feeding into `human`:
 *  1. WeaponDB[].ilup1.pad (SVECTOR's pad field, repurposed as an id) ==
 *     wid resolves an index stored into human->wepid[wpid] (item.h's
 *     proven `wepid[2]`@0x90, this function's own proof — see item.h).
 *  2. WeaponModel[].wid == wid resolves a row whose .model (lazily
 *     FileRead of "%s%s.TMD" formatted from the fixed
 *     "K:\WORK\CDIMAGE\HUMAN\WEAPON\" prefix + the row's .name) backs a
 *     LoadOrnament call; the result is stored to human->weapon[wep] and
 *     wired via GsInitCoordinate2 to human->model->object[body].
 * Ghidra completely lost the 5th (stack-passed) parameter `int wep`,
 * rendering it as an unnamed `in_stack_00000010` — PSX.SYM's prototype
 * recovers it (a known Ghidra weak spot: stack-passed args past the 4
 * register ones). `wep` is only ever used narrowed to its low 16 bits
 * (loaded `lhu` straight off the stack slot, per the Expressions
 * "narrowing use reads even a signed global with lhu" rule) — reflected
 * here as a `short` local, matching PSX.SYM's `reg $s2 short wep`.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `short i` (not `int`, per PSX.SYM) reused across BOTH searches — the
 *    narrow counter SUPPRESSES loop.c's strength reduction (Loops: "a
 *    short loop counter suppresses loop.c's strength reduction"), so the
 *    target recomputes `&WeaponDB[i]`/`&WeaponModel[i]` from scratch each
 *    iteration (sign-extend refused into the scale) instead of walking a
 *    pointer — matches plain re-indexed `WeaponDB[i]`/`WeaponModel[i]`
 *    with NO named temp for the compared field (an explicit temp, as
 *    SetupCharacterParameter's `int idx` search needed, is wrong here:
 *    it would make cc1 hoist the loop's first-iteration test into an
 *    extra branch — that trick is specific to the `int` biv/giv case).
