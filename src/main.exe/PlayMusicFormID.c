 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * STATUS: MATCHING — 176 bytes / 44 instructions.
 *
 * IDs below 100 are voice clips. Larger IDs are remapped through the
 * sentinel-terminated MusicIDTable before being passed to _PlayMusic.
 *
 * _PlayMusic's real two-argument ABI is load-bearing: treating the table and
 * sentinel as extra call arguments lengthens their live ranges and creates a
 * false address-register conflict. The named table base plus the one-shot
 * first-load fence lets cc1 retain %hi(MusicIDTable) in $a2 and materialize
 * its low half only after the sentinel branch. Assigning `j` after the match
 * guard lets the scheduler move it into that guard's delay slot and reuse
 * $v0, while the signed integer pointer sums preserve the target's
 * index-first `addu` operand order. The nested one-shot fence supplies the
 * loop weight needed for the retail register colouring without emitting code.
