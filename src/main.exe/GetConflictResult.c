/*
 * GetConflictResult (0x8001a9b8) — query the D_800BC108 conflict pool for a
 * live collision against `model`. `model->id` is its own slot in the pool; the
 * slot's `result[]` array flags which other slots it currently overlaps. When
 * `index < 0` the function SCANS result[0..ConflictObjects) for the next flagged
 * (nonzero) entry that has NOT already been consumed (bit 0x40); `offset.pad`
 * caps how many flagged entries may be examined. When `index >= 0` that specific
 * slot is used directly. On a hit the slot is marked consumed (|= 0x40), the
 * inter-model delta is published to ConflictDistance and the other model to
 * ConflictModel, and the slot index is returned; every failure path returns -1.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 38 of 368 bytes differ (arithmetically correct, right
 * length). Three independent below-the-C-level residuals remain (a decomp-permuter
 * run improves its own metric but does not beat this in raw bytes):
 *   1. Guard target (~4B): the search loop is a `for` (needed so reorg duplicates
 *      the `index+1` increment into the two skip-branch delay slots — the
 *      cookbook "loop-internal skip branch ... needs a real for" rule). cc1's
 *      duplicate_loop_exit_test then aims the top guard at the loop EXIT
 *      (post-loop, .L…aa7c); the target aims it at the shared `return -1`
 *      (.L…a9e0). Recovering that needs an explicit `if (ConflictObjects < 1)`
 *      guard whose redundant for-copy cc1 elides — but cc1 reloads the gp
 *      `ConflictObjects` (no calls, yet it won't CSE across the loop), so both
 *      guards survive; forcing one value through a local `n` reallocates the
 *      whole loop (found→t0) and regresses hard (>200B). Structural, not source.
 *   2. offset.pad / found-extension order (~8B): in the loop `offset.pad < found`,
 *      the target schedules the `(short)found` sll before the `lh` of offset.pad;
 *      cc1 emits the load first. Pure sched1 tie (the store/load-vs-alu ready
 *      tiebreak), permuter-immune.
 *   3. model lw schedule (~26B): the target hoists `pool[k].model`'s `lw` into
 *      the vx load-delay (implying a source temp `m = pool[k].model; … =m;`); cc1
 *      here fills that slot with a nop and sinks the lw into the vy region. Adding
 *      the temp DOES hoist the lw, but flips the pool[k] base register v1→v0 and
 *      drops the return move out of the jr delay slot (length 91) — a net +7B.
 *      The two are mutually exclusive from C.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md; siblings DeleteConflict.c /
 * InsertConflict.c / ProcItemMakibishi.c define the conflict-TU conventions):
 *  - `model->id` is loaded TWICE, un-CSE'd (the DeleteConflict lhu-vs-lh split):
 *    `int iVar3 = model->id;` (lh — the `== -1` guard and the loop's scan base
 *    id*0x78) and `short sVar1 = model->id;` (lhu, narrowing — the post-loop
 *    result/position base). Different machine modes don't CSE. iVar3's scan base
 *    dies once its id*0x78 invariant is hoisted, so it lands in caller-saved $v1
 *    and the post-loop index gets its own `int k`.
 *  - `if (index < 0)` is `sll a1,16; bgez` (short sign test); `found = 0;` sits
 *    before it so reorg fills the bgez delay slot, and the for-init `index = 0`
 *    cse-copies the zero (`move a2,a3`).
 *  - The `return -1`s: the `id == -1` case is a distinct `return -1` that reuses
 *    the compare's `v0 = -1` (a bare `jr;nop` at the tail); every other failure
 *    path shares one early `ret_m1:` block (label INSIDE the attribute guard, so
 *    the inverted `(attr & 0x4000) == 0` places it first) reached by `goto`.
 *  - ConflictDistance is one SVECTOR whose three fields splat auto-named as
 *    SEPARATE, ADDRESS-DRIFTED D_80097EC8/ECC + D_80097ED0 glabels (8 bytes low
 *    in the .map — see the fresh correct-address binds in config/symbols).
 *    `(short)position.vx` reads the low half `lhu` (narrowing into the s16 delta).
 *  - `do { vz…; } while (0);` is a scheduler-barrier lever (permuter-found): it
 *    keeps the model `sw`/return `move` out of the vz region so the return move
 *    lands in the jr delay slot and the function is the right length (92 insns);
 *    without it the tail is one insn short.
