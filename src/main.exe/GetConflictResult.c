 * Original parameters and locals (the demo build's register allocation may
 * differ from retail, but the COUNT and TYPES drive cc1's codegen and carry
 * over). A repeated name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:

/*
 * GetConflictResult (0x8001a9b8) — query the ConflictObject conflict pool for a
 * live collision against `model`. `model->id` is its own slot in the pool; the
 * slot's `result[]` array flags which other slots it currently overlaps. When
 * `index < 0` the function SCANS result[0..ConflictObjects) for the next flagged
 * (nonzero) entry that has NOT already been consumed (bit 0x40); `offset.pad`
 * caps how many flagged entries may be examined. When `index >= 0` that specific
 * slot is used directly. On a hit the slot is marked consumed (|= 0x40), the
 * inter-model delta is published to ConflictDistance and the other model to
 * ConflictModel, and the slot index is returned; every failure path returns -1.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md; siblings DeleteConflict.c /
 * InsertConflict.c define the conflict-TU conventions). Three former
 * "below-the-C-level" residuals all turned out to be source structure,
 * found by RTL-dump analysis (cc1 -dj/-dc/-dS/-dg/-dl/-dJ/-dR/-dd):
 *  - id-guard is NESTED (`if (id != -1) { ... } return -1;`, DeleteConflict's
 *    own style), NOT an early `return -1;` guard: the final `return -1` is the
 *    id-guard's else path, cse elides its `li v0,-1` along the beq's taken edge
 *    (v0 still holds the compare's -1; single-predecessor label), leaving a
 *    bare label between the success `return index` and the function end. That
 *    label blocks jump.c's jump-to-next deletion, so the success return stays
 *    a real jump that reorg's make_return_insns converts to its OWN `jr` with
 *    `addu v0,a3` in the delay slot, followed by the bare `jr; nop` island the
 *    id==-1 beq targets. (An early-return spelling instead merges the success
 *    return into the island: shared jr, move outside the slot — 8B off.)
 *  - `ConflictModel = ...` is the FIRST store of the publish group (before
 *    .vx/.vy/.vz): sched1 then drops its lw into the vx pair's load-delay slot
 *    and its sw into the vy pair's, and the vz temps allocate to v1/a0 reusing
 *    the dying k-base (the `do{}while(0)` barrier hack this file used to carry
 *    is not needed). Ordering the model store between vx and vy instead leaves
 *    a nop in the vx slot and shifts sw below the vy subu (~26B).
 *  - The scan-loop guard: `index = 0; if (index >= ConflictObjects) goto
 *    ret_m1;` then `for (; index < ConflictObjects; index++)`. The guard's
 *    test folds (index==0 by cse) to `blez N -> ret_m1`, and cse1's
 *    record_jump_equiv on its fallthrough records LT(idx0, N) on the
 *    zero-valued quantity, which lets fold_rtx delete the for's
 *    duplicate_loop_exit_test entry copy (comparison_dominates_p(LT,LT) —
 *    the recorded comparison must sit on the copy's FIRST slt operand, which
 *    is why the guard must compare INDEX against N, not `ConflictObjects < 1`:
 *    that records on N's quantity and never folds — both blez's survive).
 *    The loop must stay a real `for`: duplicate_loop_exit_test's
 *    NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP makes reorg's mostly_true_jump predict the
 *    result==0 skip-branch taken, filling both skip delay slots from the
 *    continue-point (`addiu v0,a2,1` twice); a do-while has no VTOP, the EQ
 *    heuristic predicts not-taken, and the fills come from the fallthrough.
 *  - The pad cap is `found > ConflictObject[iVar3].offset.pad` (found FIRST):
 *    expand evaluates op0 first, putting the (short)found sll before the
 *    lh of offset.pad (spelling it `pad < found` loads first — not a sched
 *    tie).
 *  - `model->id` is loaded TWICE, un-CSE'd (the DeleteConflict lhu-vs-lh
 *    split): `int iVar3 = model->id;` (lh — the `== -1` guard and the scan
 *    base id*0x78) and `short sVar1 = model->id;` (lhu, narrowing — the
 *    post-loop result/position base). Different machine modes don't CSE.
 *  - `if (index < 0)` is `sll a1,16; bgez` (short sign test); `found = 0;`
 *    sits before it so reorg fills the bgez delay slot, and `index = 0`
 *    cse-copies the zero (`move a2,a3`).
 *  - All mid-function failure paths `goto ret_m1;`, a label INSIDE the
 *    attribute guard (the inverted `(attr & 0x4000) == 0` places its
 *    `jr; li v0,-1` island first, at 0x8001A9E0).
 *  - ConflictDistance is one SVECTOR whose three fields splat auto-named as
 *    SEPARATE, ADDRESS-DRIFTED D_80097EC8/ECC + D_80097ED0 glabels (8 bytes low
 *    in the .map — see the fresh correct-address binds in config/symbols).
 *    `(short)position.vx` reads the low half `lhu` (narrowing into the s16
 *    delta).
