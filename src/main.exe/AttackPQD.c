/*
 * AttackPQD (0x80027688, 0xa8 bytes) — weapon holster/draw swap: on a
 * matching motion-frame trigger (dtM->count, MotionManager's proven
 * `count` field) or a wildcard trigger (efrm == -1), draws the holstered
 * weapon at weapon[3] into weapon[0] (the active slot) and clears
 * weapon[3]; on the OTHER trigger frame (dtM->count == sfrm), holsters the
 * active weapon[0] into weapon[2] instead. Either swap plays a sound
 * (Sound(human, seid), seid=1 for draw / 0 for holster) — unless the
 * source slot was already empty, in which case it's a silent no-op.
 *
 * Humanoid's weapon[4] array (equipped melee/ranged ornaments — reference/
 * ghidra_types.h's fuller independently-built Humanoid struct, "right/left
 * active + right/left inactive" per game_types.h's Humanoid sibling
 * comment) was hidden inside item.h's opaque pad2b span; extended item.h
 * to reveal it (report: item.h's Humanoid.pad2b[0x34]@0x78 split into
 * pad2b[0x1C]@0x78 + weapon[4]@0x94 + illusion[2]@0xA4, matching
 * game_types.h's already-proven boundaries for this same region).
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `human = Me_MOTION_C;` cached ONCE (a local, not a repeated global
 *    re-read) is what keeps it in one register for the whole function —
 *    Ghidra's rendering inconsistently mixes the "human" and "Me_MOTION_C"
 *    names for the SAME loaded value; the asm only ever loads it once.
 *  - `count = dtM->count;` is ALSO cached once at the top (Ghidra's own
 *    `temp_v1` rendering) and reused by BOTH the outer test and the
 *    CASE_B test — the two tests are in different basic blocks, so a
 *    fresh re-read of `dtM->count` at each site would reload; only a
 *    genuine shared local reproduces the single `lh`.
 *  - `ppOVar1 = human->weapon;` (the array's base, `human+0x94`) is ALSO
 *    hoisted unconditionally to the top (its `addiu` sits in the FIRST
 *    branch's delay slot — computed before either arm is chosen). BOTH
 *    weapon[2] AND weapon[3] are reached exclusively through `ppOVar1`
 *    (`ppOVar1[2]`/`ppOVar1[3]`) in EVERY branch, never through
 *    `human->weapon[2/3]` directly, even in the branch where that index is
 *    the "own" one being tested — only weapon[0] (offset 0) stays on
 *    `human` directly (folds the 0x94 displacement into human's own
 *    register). Trust the register the raw asm actually uses, not
 *    Ghidra's inconsistent per-statement naming of the identical address.
 *  - Register-allocation tie (permuter, bisected — see below): CASE_A's
 *    "own slot" store must be a CHAINED assignment,
 *    `t0 = (ppOVar1[2] = human->weapon[0]);`, not the seemingly-equivalent
 *    `t0 = human->weapon[0]; ppOVar1[2] = t0;` — the chained form is what
 *    makes cc1 reuse $v0 for weapon[0]'s value (clobbering the
 *    already-tested weapon[3] value and forcing ITS reload into a fresh
 *    register for the swap), matching the target's `lw`+reload shape.
 *    CASE_B needs the opposite: a PLAIN, temp-free inline read at the
 *    store site (`human->weapon[0] = ppOVar1[2];`, no `tOther`) — adding a
 *    symmetric temp/chain here (the naive mirror of CASE_A's fix)
 *    regressed the WHOLE function (even un-did CASE_A's own fix and the
 *    unrelated `count`/`ppOVar1` register choice), since global-alloc's
 *    priority ordering is whole-function, not per-branch. Found via
 *    `tools/permute.py --stop-on-zero` (one ~2 min run, score 0 on the
 *    first `--stop-on-zero` hit) after the plain temp-per-branch draft
 *    landed on a 20-byte pure register-coloring residual that neither
 *    statement order nor declaration order moved; the winning candidate
 *    also had two dead `if (!ppOVar1) {}` / bare `;` no-ops that bisection
 *    showed were NOT load-bearing (removed here).
 *  - `if (count == efrm || efrm == -1)` keeps Ghidra's literal polarity
 *    (De-Morgan lever: an `||`'s THEN body is reached by the first
 *    disjunct's taken branch OR the second disjunct's fallthrough —
 *    already the asm's shape, no inversion needed here, unlike a plain
 *    single-condition if/else).
 *  - `seid` is plain `s32` (not `s16`): it's only ever a call argument
 *    (never stored/compared), and the asm materializes it with a full-word
 *    `addiu`/`addu` from zero, not a halfword store — no narrowing.
