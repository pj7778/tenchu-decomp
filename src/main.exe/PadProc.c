 * void PadProc(void);
 *     PADCMD.C:249, 25 src lines, frame 24 bytes, saved-reg mask 0x80010000 (DEMO build -- see below)
 *
 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     reg   $a0       int ct
 *
 * Globals it touches, as the original declared them:
 *     extern unsigned char ComBuf[2][34];
 *     extern struct tag_TItem items[30];
 *     extern struct PADCMD__141fake PadArrange;
 *     extern struct TPadPort PadPort[2][4];

/*
 * PadProc (0x8001ada4) services the direct pad and multitap header, then
 * advances PadArrange's attack/release rumble envelope.  The expired-release
 * path turns both actuators off without performing the second time increment.
 *
 * PadShock appears earlier in the original PADCMD.C and is inlined at the
 * three writes here.  Its second actuator argument is an int, while act2 is a
 * raw unsigned byte: negative values are converted to the 0..255 byte domain
 * by adding 0x100 before the actuator pair is written.  GCC removes that
 * source branch after QImode truncation, so standalone PadShock's instructions
 * are unchanged.  Before jump folding, however, the two real pair-write paths
 * keep both arguments live; that produces retail's a3 constant, a0 quotient,
 * branch-specific PadPort pointers, and instruction order in both envelope
 * arms.  The demo and trial PadProc bodies have the same register graph, and
 * the demo line table places each inlined expansion on PADCMD.C lines 260 and
 * 266 (with the motor-off expansion on line 270).
