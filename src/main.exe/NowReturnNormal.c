 * NowReturnNormal (0x80027004) — force a character back into its normal
 * stance. Latches the character into Me_MOTION_C, calls ReturnNormal() to
 * pick the "return to normal" motion id + move flag (written into the
 * globals motID / D_80097F0E), then applies them via the *exact*
 * guard/UpdateMotion/MoveHumanoid shape SetNowMotion uses on its parameters
 * (see SetNowMotion.c's header for the mid<<16/dual-sra + De Morgan guard
 * mechanics) — reload Me_MOTION_C/motID/D_80097F0E AFTER the call since it
 * may have written them (the compiler can't assume otherwise across a call).
 * motID/D_80097F0E are u16 (lhu on first read), but each is copied into a
 * `short` local before use (matching SetNowMotion's `short mid`/`short move`
 * parameter types) — that's what makes the later signed sra/sll+beqz
 * idioms (not andi) reappear here despite the globals being unsigned.
