/*
 * SelectCameraOwnerOption (0x8005ba08, 0x158 bytes) — debug menu's "select
 * camera owner" submenu (LayoutEnemyOption dispatch case 7): builds an
 * AdtSelect menu of every live Humanoid's index ("%d") -> pointer pair, lets
 * the user pick one, and re-centers the debug camera (ViewInfo) on the
 * chosen Humanoid's model position.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 4 of 344 bytes differ (1 instruction: same operands,
 * different opcode). Everything else below is verified byte-exact against
 * the original (confirmed via tools/asmdiff.py): frame layout, loop shape,
 * variable unification, store order, and the gp/drift fixes.
 * The sole residual: `sprintf(buffer, hi + 0x7D70, iVar2);` (the FileOption.c
 * "round-constant hi pointer" idiom, `hi = (char *)0x80090000;`) compiles the
 * offset-add as `ori $a1,$s3,0x7d70` here but the target has `addiu
 * $a1,$s3,0x7d70` — bit-identical VALUE (s3's low 16 bits are already zero,
 * so plus and ior agree), different OPCODE ENCODING, so still a byte diff.
 * FileOption.c's OWN COMPILED OUTPUT uses the exact same source idiom and
 * gets `addiu` — the difference must be in surrounding context (FileOption's
 * `hi` lives across a REAL `for` loop with loop notes; this function's `hi`
 * lives across a hand-rolled GOTO loop with none, required instead to keep
 * `&targets[i]` from being loop.c-strength-reduced into a wrong walking
 * pointer — a do-while/while(1)+break here reproduces the `ori` AND breaks
 * the array indexing, so the two constraints could not be reconciled with
 * the levers tried: routing the offset through a named `s32 off = 0x7D70;`
 * (worse — forces a full second register + explicit `or`), reordering `hi`'s
 * assignment, and reordering the `vrx`/`vpx`/`vry`/`vpy`/`vrz`/`vpz` store
 * sequence (which DID fix a separate, now-resolved 4-store residual below).
 * tools/permute.py ran ~20 min (`-j4`, --stop-on-zero) against this exact
 * 1-instruction residual and found nothing better than the base — a named
 * sub-C-level tie (cookbook "sub-C-level residual early-stop"); parked here
 * rather than opening more sessions on it.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - Real retail layout differs from PSX.SYM's (earlier-build) recollection:
 *    the raw asm places `msg` at sp+0x130 (304), not PSX.SYM's sp+264, which
 *    means `targets` is 36 entries (0x120 bytes), matching Ghidra's own
 *    TAdtSelect[36] rather than PSX.SYM's [31] — the asm wins (frame
 *    0x2A8 = args/pad + targets 0x120 + msg 0x160 + 5 saved regs + pad).
 *  - `CamState.Owner = (Humanoid *)AdtSelect(...)` writes the SAME address a
 *    different TU's small `CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR` aliases
 *    (cookbook: cross-TU field aliasing) — write it as CamState.Owner, the
 *    proven shared struct, not a separate symbol.
 *  - The three `CamState.Owner->model->locate.coord.t[i]` reads are kept as
 *    three independent, uncached expressions (no `model` temp): the asm
 *    reloads Owner->model fresh via v0 (Owner) for EACH of the three t[i]
 *    accesses (three separate `lw ?,0x58(v0)`), which only happens when the
 *    source repeats the whole chain rather than caching a `model` pointer.
 *  - The coordinate copy is spelled `vrx`/`vry`/`vrz` = t[0..2] (direct reads)
 *    then `vpx=vrx; vpy=vry-5000; vpz=vrz;` (plain copies) — the OPPOSITE of
 *    Ghidra's naming (which computes into vpx/vry/vpz and copies vrx=vpx,
 *    vrz=vpz). The asm's actual value-to-register binding proves it: `t[0]`
 *    stores to vrx's offset FIRST (needs the full address), and the vpx
 *    store (offset 0, foldable through the address's hi-only register) is
 *    scheduled much later, matching a plain-copy-from-vrx shape, not
 *    Ghidra's reverse. Fixed a 6-instruction register-identity mismatch.
 *  - No %gp_rel symbols in this function (tools/gpsyms.py): Humans/
 *    HumanGroup are another TU's smalls, absolute here.
 *  - The inner do-while (Ghidra's do{...}while(iVar2<Humans)) is a
 *    HAND-ROLLED goto loop in source, not a real do-while: the target
 *    recomputes `&targets[i]` (sp+16+i*8) fresh every iteration rather than
 *    hoisting it to a preheader, which only happens when there are no loop
 *    notes for loop.c to act on (cookbook Loops: a hand-rolled goto loop
 *    "loses hoisting"; same lesson as PutNumber's /10 magic constant).
 *  - Ghidra's `iVar2`/`iVar3` are ONE variable, not two: they hold the same
 *    value at every point they're both live, and writing them as a single
 *    `iVar2` avoids an extra a3<->s0 copy-chain the real do-while's
 *    duplicate-name rendering would otherwise force into a separate pseudo.
 *  - `D_80097D70` (the "%d" format string) is a splat auto-name drifted -8
 *    bytes in this run (a whole D_80097D68..D_80097D90 chain shares the
 *    offset — verified against the .map). Bound a fresh
 *    `D_80097D70 = 0x80097D70;` in config/symbols.main.exe.txt per the
 *    cookbook's drifted-symbol recipe rather than fight the wrong auto-name.
