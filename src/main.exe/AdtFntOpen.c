/*
 * AdtFntOpen (0x8005fbdc) — font-adapter open: opens the PSYQ libgpu font
 * stream via FntOpen(x,y,w,h,isbg,n), forwarding all SIX parameters
 * unchanged (x-h stay live in $a0-$a3 from entry straight through to the
 * call; only the two stack-passed trailing params isbg/n are visibly
 * reloaded — m2c only shows those two as the call's args because it can't
 * see untouched incoming registers, see docs/matching-cookbook.md's
 * "leading argument…invisible to m2c" note; Ghidra's full 6-arg call is
 * the real one), then stashes every argument into the font-adapter state
 * D_8008F1B8 (same global as AdtFntLoad.c's tx/ty@0x18/0x1C and
 * AdtQuiet.c's quiet@0x20 — this TU only reaches offsets 0x0-0x14, its own
 * per-TU "declare only the fields you touch" view).
