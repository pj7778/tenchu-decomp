/*
 * Sound (0x8004fef8) — play a character's sound effect. `seid` with any of the
 * high nibble set (0xf0) is an explicit id: play it at the character's position.
 * Otherwise it's a "category" (< 0x10): ids >= 6 are gated by a global mute
 * (D_80097CB4) and the character's 0x80 attribute (e.g. dead/silent), and the
 * character's own default sound (Humanoid.sound) is OR'd in.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - Written `if (seid & 0xf0) {simple} else {gated}` (opposite polarity to
 *    Ghidra's `== 0`): the beqz branches to the gated body and the simple body
 *    falls through with a `j` to the shared SoundEx call.
 *  - `seid` is a short: the >5 test and each arg pass sign-extend it (sll/sra).
 *  - SoundEx returns s16 here (item.h) — the result is Sound's return, so the
 *    `return -1` paths share its sign-extend tail (cross-jump merge).
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 5 bytes (a pure register-allocation tie). The draft is
 * arithmetically correct and the right length; only the `seid | human->sound`
 * else-branch differs: the target loads `human->sound` into the arg reg $a1 and
 * ORs `seid` (kept in $v1) into it (`lhu a1; or a1,v1,a1`), whereas cc1 here
 * loads sound into $v0 and reassigns `seid`/$v1 (`lhu v0; or v1,v1,v0; sll
 * a1,v1`). Every source form that avoids reassigning `seid` (inline arg, separate
 * temp, two shared-tail returns) makes cc1 repartition $a0/$a1 wholesale (worse).
 * A decomp-permuter run of ~447k iterations never beat the score-25 base, so the
 * swap is below the C level (a scheduler/allocator tie source can't steer here).
