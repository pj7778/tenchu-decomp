/*
 * Think1ninja (0x8002c238, 0x164 bytes) — think-handler for a ninja-type
 * enemy: does nothing while jumping (character_status == 9); otherwise runs
 * an actscnt-gated (every 31st call, matching Think1watch's/Think1trace's
 * old-actscnt idiom) random-action roll (Think1random) that, specifically
 * while the current motion is 0x200/0 (mid==0x200 && count==0, read as ONE
 * word compare — matches Ghidra's own split-then-recombine rendering),
 * checks whether stepping forward would change the character's area-map
 * level (an edge/stair/ledge check, same GetAreaMapLevel/GlobalAreaMap
 * idiom as turn_towards_player_.c's obstacle probe) and forces a "stop and
 * turn" result (0x1040) if so, or if the forward area-level probe itself is
 * far enough away (> 0x17D4); otherwise returns the random roll. ALL
 * BYTE-PROVEN except the residual below.
 *
 * `Me_THINK_C->map` (game_types.h, new field, MapVector — replaces 8 of the
 * unnamed placeholder bytes right after `buttons`): the asm reads ALL 4
 * bytes at once (`lw`, not four `lbu`s) and compares directly against a
 * GetAreaMapLevel return value — this is Ghidra's own independently-built
 * Humanoid struct's `MapVector map { long level; long height; }` at the
 * exact same offset (right after Humanoid's own PADtype pad). Only `level`
 * is byte-proven here; `height` is un-exercised but kept (not invented —
 * Ghidra's own fuller struct already has it at this offset).
 *
 * `*(s32 *)Me_THINK_C->motion == 0x200` reads
 * BOTH `animation_state_perhaps`(mid, offset 0) and
 * `frames_since_animation_start`(count, offset 2) as one 32-bit compare —
 * the asm's single `lw`+compare (0x200 as a little-endian word is
 * mid=0x200,count=0) — matches Ghidra's own split-field rendering
 * (`iVar5._0_2_`/`iVar5._2_2_`) of the exact same instruction.
 *
 * `(s16)Me_THINK_C->status` (cast at the use site): the proven
 * shared field is u16, but THIS TU's asm reads it with `lh` (signed) — the
 * same per-TU load-width disagreement already established for `lifemax`
 * (item.h) — keep the header's u16, cast here.
 *
 * `Think1random` takes ZERO arguments (not `Think1random(Me_THINK_C)` as
 * m2c's naive per-register liveness rendering suggests): $a0 still holds
 * Me_THINK_C at the call site (unclobbered since function entry), which
 * m2c mis-reads as an argument — the same m2c-over-counts-call-args tell as
 * Think1watch's `rand()`. Confirmed empirically: declaring it with an
 * argument compiled an extra, wrong `lw $a0,Me_THINK_C` reload right before
 * the `jal`.  Its original s16 return type is equally load-bearing: an s32
 * declaration creates a full-width return-copy pseudo that CSE carries to a
 * later return, displacing the real `result` from $s1.
 *
 * `field6_0xc` (already-named placeholder, offset 0xC) is also read here as
 * a move-speed magnitude input (`field6_0xc * 5`) — the SAME field
 * turn_towards_player_.c passes to GetMoveSpeed's `width` parameter at the
 * same offset (cross-function corroboration; not renamed here since
 * turn_towards_player_.c — outside this batch — already references it by
 * this name).
 *
 * The `abs_d2 < 500` branch jumps DIRECTLY past the `d2 <= 0x17D4` check to
 * the shared `result = 0x1040` body (a labeled shared-return body, per the
 * cookbook's "write the constant once, goto in" rule) — plain nested
 * if/else would re-test d2 and diverge from the asm.
 *
 * The nonnegative-first absolute-value ternary is also intentional.  It
 * reaches cc1's abssi2 expansion and emits the target's `bgez`, copy, and
 * self-negate sequence; the negative-first ternary instead folds the copy
 * away.  This shape and the s16 call prototype must be changed together.
