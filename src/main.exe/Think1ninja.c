/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 6 of 356 bytes differ (right length: matchdiff's
 * whole-image count equals the function-local count; asmdiff confirms 89
 * instructions on both sides, only 3 differing).
 *
 * Think1ninja (0x8002c238, 0x164 bytes) — think-handler for a ninja-type
 * enemy: does nothing while jumping (character_status == 9); otherwise runs
 * an actscnt-gated (every 31st call, matching Think1watch's/Think1trace's
 * old-actscnt idiom) random-action roll (Think1random) that, specifically
 * while the current motion is 0x200/0 (mid==0x200 && count==0, read as ONE
 * word compare — matches Ghidra's own split-then-recombine rendering),
 * checks whether stepping forward would change the character's area-map
 * level (an edge/stair/ledge check, same GetAreaMapLevel/GlobalAreaMap
 * idiom as turn_towards_player_.c's obstacle probe) and forces a "stop and
 * turn" result (0x1040) if so, or if the forward area-level probe itself is
 * far enough away (> 0x17D4); otherwise returns the random roll. ALL
 * BYTE-PROVEN except the residual below.
 *
 * `Me_THINK_C->map` (game_types.h, new field, MapVector — replaces 8 of the
 * unnamed placeholder bytes right after `buttons`): the asm reads ALL 4
 * bytes at once (`lw`, not four `lbu`s) and compares directly against a
 * GetAreaMapLevel return value — this is Ghidra's own independently-built
 * Humanoid struct's `MapVector map { long level; long height; }` at the
 * exact same offset (right after Humanoid's own PADtype pad). Only `level`
 * is byte-proven here; `height` is un-exercised but kept (not invented —
 * Ghidra's own fuller struct already has it at this offset).
 *
 * `*(s32 *)Me_THINK_C->something_about_current_animation == 0x200` reads
 * BOTH `animation_state_perhaps`(mid, offset 0) and
 * `frames_since_animation_start`(count, offset 2) as one 32-bit compare —
 * the asm's single `lw`+compare (0x200 as a little-endian word is
 * mid=0x200,count=0) — matches Ghidra's own split-field rendering
 * (`iVar5._0_2_`/`iVar5._2_2_`) of the exact same instruction.
 *
 * `(s16)Me_THINK_C->character_status` (cast at the use site): the proven
 * shared field is u16, but THIS TU's asm reads it with `lh` (signed) — the
 * same per-TU load-width disagreement already established for `lifemax`
 * (item.h) — keep the header's u16, cast here.
 *
 * `Think1random` takes ZERO arguments (not `Think1random(Me_THINK_C)` as
 * m2c's naive per-register liveness rendering suggests): $a0 still holds
 * Me_THINK_C at the call site (unclobbered since function entry), which
 * m2c mis-reads as an argument — the same m2c-over-counts-call-args tell as
 * Think1watch's `rand()`. Confirmed empirically: declaring it with an
 * argument compiled an extra, wrong `lw $a0,Me_THINK_C` reload right before
 * the `jal`.
 *
 * `field6_0xc` (already-named placeholder, offset 0xC) is also read here as
 * a move-speed magnitude input (`field6_0xc * 5`) — the SAME field
 * turn_towards_player_.c passes to GetMoveSpeed's `width` parameter at the
 * same offset (cross-function corroboration; not renamed here since
 * turn_towards_player_.c — outside this batch — already references it by
 * this name).
 *
 * The `abs_d2 < 500` branch jumps DIRECTLY past the `d2 <= 0x17D4` check to
 * the shared `result = 0x1040` body (a labeled shared-return body, per the
 * cookbook's "write the constant once, goto in" rule) — plain nested
 * if/else would re-test d2 and diverge from the asm.
 *
 * RESIDUAL (6 bytes / 3 instructions, inside the `d1 == map.level` block's
 * abs-value computation): the target computes `abs_d2` via an explicit
 * `move $v0,$a0` THEN `negu $v0,$v0` (self-negate, matching the established
 * "conditional negate re-reads its own destination" idiom) on the `d2 < 0`
 * path, sharing ONE `slti $v0,$v0,500` at the join for BOTH paths. This
 * draft's cc1 instead eliminates the redundant move (`negu $v0,$a0`
 * directly) and schedules an extra/relocated `slti` — same final values,
 * one fewer instruction on this path, made up for by a different rescheduled
 * instruction elsewhere in the SAME 3-line span (net length unchanged).
 * Tried and rejected (all reproduce the identical 3-line residual): the
 * exact `abs_d2 = d2; if (d2 < 0) abs_d2 = -abs_d2;` shape (this draft);
 * testing `abs_d2 < 0` instead of `d2 < 0`; De Morgan `if (0 > d2)`; a
 * ternary initializer (`abs_d2 = d2 < 0 ? -d2 : d2;`); an explicit
 * if/else (`if (d2<0) abs_d2=-d2; else abs_d2=d2;`). Leaving `abs_d2`
 * conditionally uninitialized (mirroring the literal move+negu-only-on-the-
 * negative-path shape, relying on register reuse for the other path) does
 * NOT reproduce it either — it cascades into a much larger, unrelated
 * diff, so the target's shape is not a simple "asymmetric assignment"
 * artifact. `tools/autorules.py` tried every local's width (actscnt/result/
 * d1/d2/abs_d2) with no improvement. This is the redundant-move-elimination
 * tie family (same mechanism as the documented reload/schedule ties, just a
 * dead-store/copy form of it) — not chased further with the permuter per
 * the attempt-cap guidance (this batch's other two permuter runs, on
 * Think3firstattack/Think3escape, both showed scores uncorrelated with the
 * real byte-diff scale, suggesting a harness issue rather than a
 * real search surface here). decomp.me (psyq4.3 preset) would be the next
 * arbiter if revisited.
