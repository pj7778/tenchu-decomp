/*
 * FUN_80018f00 (0x80018f00, 0x110 bytes) — FILEIO.C's "stop the access
 * indicator" routine: disarms the vsync draw callback (`VSyncCallback(0)`,
 * the opposite of PrepareAccess's `VSyncCallback(cbAccess)`), and if the
 * meter was still armed (`AccessPower >= 0`) draws ONE final all-black
 * `AccessImage` quad to erase it from the screen before the callback stops
 * running — same DRAWENV/DISPENV swap-and-restore idiom as cbAccess.c (its
 * header comment names this file as the sibling to read for that shape:
 * `n_draw = o_draw;` is a plain DRAWENV struct assignment, `n_draw.clip =
 * o_disp.disp;` a plain RECT assignment, both matching cc1's emit_block_move
 * shape rather than Ghidra's field-by-field unrolling). Called from
 * FileRead.c only (once, straight-line, after the ReadMode dispatch); not in
 * the demo's PSX.SYM (a retail-only addition, unlike its FILEIO.C siblings
 * InitAccessInfo/cbAccess/PrepareAccess/FileRead which the demo already had).
 * No candidate name in reference/psxsym-candidates.tsv; not proposing one
 * without corroboration.
 *
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 11 of 272 bytes differ (both drafts below are the
 * SAME 68-instruction length as the target — no whole-image shift).
 *
 * `&o_draw` is used 3 times (GetDrawEnv's arg, the `n_draw = o_draw;`
 * block-move's source, and the final `PutDrawEnv(&o_draw)` restore), exactly
 * cbAccess.c's already-documented open case: cc1 merges the FIRST TWO uses
 * (the ones either side of the single intervening GetDispEnv() call) into
 * ONE value kept live in a callee-saved register, where the target instead
 * recomputes `sp+40` fresh at all three sites in caller-saved regs with no
 * $s-register at all. Declaring `o_draw` FIRST among the three locals (this
 * file's current order) avoids that merge entirely and reaches the target's
 * exact 68-instruction count and register content — a NEW lever beyond
 * cbAccess's failed attempts (autorules, a do{}while(0) wrapper, declaration
 * order was tried there but not this specific "address-taken-first" ordering)
 * — but it also feeds cc1's stack-slot allocator, which assigns slots in
 * LOCAL-DECLARATION order (first declared = lowest address): with `o_draw`
 * declared first it lands at sp+16 and `o_disp` at sp+112, whereas the
 * target has `o_disp` at sp+16 and `o_draw` at sp+40 (`n_draw` is correctly
 * at sp+136 either way). Declaring `o_disp` first instead (matching the
 * target's slot order) reintroduces the register merge (69 vs 68
 * instructions, the cbAccess shape) — every declaration order tried
 * (all 6 permutations, plus nesting `o_disp`/`n_draw` inside the `if` body)
 * gave EITHER the correct length XOR the correct slots, never both.
 * `tools/permute.py` reports its base (this file) as score 0 immediately
 * (no candidate written) — its scorer does not penalize this stack-offset
 * residual, so it is USELESS here; `tools/matchdiff.py` (11 bytes) is the
 * only trustworthy signal. `tools/autorules.py` finds no improving edit.
 * Root cause is the same open "repeated frame address recomputed vs.
 * CSE-merged across one intervening call" class as cbAccess.
 *
 * RTL escalation (this session, `tools/rtldump.py --draft` + `.greg`):
 * with `o_disp` declared first (correct slot order), `.greg` shows only 3
 * pseudos left to global-alloc — 107/106/108, the block-move's
 * source/dest/limit cursors — with `107 preferences: 16` ($s0): 107 is a
 * copy of the loop-preheader's re-materialization of `&o_draw`, which
 * local-alloc has ALREADY committed to hard reg 16 because its live range
 * (first use at `GetDrawEnv`'s call arg, next use after the intervening
 * `GetDispEnv` call) crosses two calls — global-alloc just inherits that
 * preference. This is a LOCAL-ALLOC decision made before global-alloc runs,
 * keyed on the pseudo's live range shape, not its stack address value.
 * Also tried and ALSO merges (ruling out block-scope depth as an
 * independent lever): keeping `o_disp` in the outer function scope (for
 * correct slot order) while nesting `o_draw`/`n_draw` alone inside the `if`
 * body — identical `.s` to the flat `o_disp,o_draw,n_draw` order, byte for
 * byte. So the tie is governed by `o_draw`'s DECL being function-first
 * among the three (regardless of nesting depth or the resulting stack
 * offset): declared first, its address pseudo's live range apparently
 * starts/ends such that local-alloc doesn't fix it early, and each of the
 * three uses gets a fresh caller-saved recompute instead. No source
 * respelling found that gets `o_draw` both declared-first (avoids the
 * cross-call fixation) AND slotted second (the target's frame layout) —
 * recognize this as a genuine local-alloc-before-global-alloc tie, not an
 * unexplored declaration-order gap.
