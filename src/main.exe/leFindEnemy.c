 * docs/psx-sym.md. Do not hand-edit.
 *
 * int leFindEnemy(void);
 *     WORLD.C:1099, 31 src lines, frame 88 bytes, saved-reg mask 0x807f0000 (DEMO build -- see below)
 *
 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     reg   $s1       int i
 *     reg   $s6       long px
 *     reg   $s5       long py
 *     reg   $s4       long pz
 *     reg   $s3       int find
 *     reg   $s2       int r
 *     reg   $v1       int rr
 *     stack sp+16     struct SVECTOR pow
 *     stack sp+24     struct VECTOR pos
 *
 * Globals it touches, as the original declared them:
 *     extern struct TEnemyLayout enemy[30];
 * END PSX.SYM */

/*
 * leFindEnemy (0x8003c470, 0x1a4 bytes) — `le`=layout-enemy family (see
 * leAddPath.c/leResetPath.c for TEnemyLayout): scans the 30-slot `enemy[]`
 * table for the live (`type != -1`) entry nearest CamState.Owner's model
 * position, returning its index (or -1 if none is closer than the initial
 * 2000-unit cutoff). On a hit, spawns the same marker explosion effect as
 * leAddPath (SetExplosion with a zeroed rotation and the found enemy's own
 * x/y/z) at the found enemy's position.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - `local_48 = D_80097ABC[0];` (the whole-SVECTOR copy) is computed BEFORE
 *    the `memset` call in source, not after — same pooled rodata constant
 *    as leAddPath.c, same lwl/lwr+swl/swr block-copy shape.
 *  - The zeroed/filled VECTOR is a SEPARATE staging local from the one
 *    passed to SetExplosion: `local_40` gets memset then vx/vy/vz filled
 *    from `enemy[find]`, and `pos = local_40;` (a whole 4-word struct copy,
 *    including the untouched zero `pad`) is what SetExplosion actually
 *    receives — not a fused "memset+fill one local" shape. PSX.SYM's demo
 *    build only names the one surviving local (`pos`); retail keeps the
 *    staging copy.
 *  - `enemy[find]`'s address is computed as `find*17*8` (`(find<<4)+find,
 *    then <<3`), the compiler's own strength-reduced multiply by
 *    sizeof(TEnemyLayout)==0x88 — write plain `&enemy[find]`, not a manual
 *    shift/add, and let cc1 pick this multiply sequence itself.
