/* STATUS: MATCHED — exact 1076 bytes / 269 instructions.
 *
 * ROUND 5 disproved the parked allocation floor by replacing the byte-chased
 * glyph loop as one coherent source package.  The retail target preserves the
 * demo's human structure: the PSX.SYM `u` local is the inner pixel counter;
 * `bitmap[v][15 - u]` is one ternary assignment; and the font-selection
 * if/else is plain control flow.  Removing the five nested one-shot fences
 * around that selection demoted `font` naturally, so `bits`/font/u landed in
 * the target $a1/$a2/$t0 homes with no carrier or weighting trick.  Writing
 * `v = 0` before `fill_white = 0x7fff` then put the zero init in the guard's
 * delay slot and closed the final two-instruction reorder.
 *
 * ROUNDS 1–4 below are retained as a falsified local-minimum autopsy: their
 * priority and conflict measurements were accurate for the scaffolded draft,
 * but their conclusions did not transfer to the human decomposition.
 * (ROUND 3 improved that old draft from 11/1076; ROUND 4 parked it at 9.)
 *
 * Exact instruction sequence; the ORIGINAL residual (ROUND 1/2) was a 3-cycle
 * register rotation in the bitmap-fill loop:
 *     col (inner var)  ours $a1  <->  target $t0
 *     bits             ours $t1  <->  target $a1
 *     fill_white       ours $t0  <->  target $t1
 *
 * DIAGNOSIS (global.c allocno_compare, verified against all 25 allocnos of
 * this function via tools/regalloc.py):
 *     priority = floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length * 10000
 * where n_refs is LOOP-DEPTH-WEIGHTED (each RTL mention counts its depth).
 * Measured here: col 16/30 -> 21333, font 19/43 -> 17674, v 35/111 -> 15765,
 * fill_white 19/80 -> 9500, bits 7/19 -> 7368. Allocation walks that order and
 * takes the lowest free reg (MIPS REG_ALLOC_ORDER v0,v1,a0,a1,a2,a3,t0,t1...),
 * which reproduces our a1,a2,a3,t0,t1 exactly.
 *
 * The target's registers require the order  bits > font > v > col > fill_white.
 * So bits must outrank font: >17674 needs n_refs >= 12 at live_length 19.
 * bits has exactly TWO RTL mentions -- def at loop depth 3 (+3) and one use at
 * depth 4 (+4) = 7, and that is forced by the (already byte-identical) insn
 * sequence. Every extra mention costs an instruction. The only other way to
 * claim $a1 from last place is a hard-reg preference (regs_someone_prefers),
 * and gcc-2.8.1 records those ONLY from a pseudo<->hard-reg copy, i.e. a call;
 * loop 1 contains none. Both levers are therefore out of reach from C.
 *
 * MEASURED, so the next lane need not re-derive (all rebuilt + matchdiff'd):
 *   - col == u merged (PSX.SYM lists one `u`):  11 -> 38. Refuted. Target's
 *     loop-1 inner var and loop-2 `u` share $t0 but are NOT one variable --
 *     merging raises n_refs, so the pseudo allocates EARLIER and takes a LOWER
 *     reg ($a2), displacing font.
 *   - `*pixel = 0x7fff` literal instead of fill_white: LENGTH 1084 != 1076.
 *     Refuted -- fill_white must be a real local despite PSX.SYM's 7-local list.
 *   - dropping `final_u = fill_white`: 11 -> 33, but it DOES move fill_white
 *     t0->t1 (correct!) by removing one depth-4 ref. This is the one verified
 *     lever on this residual; it regresses the tail because final_u is reused
 *     at the GetTPage block.
 *   - byte-swap inlined into the `if` (as Ghidra renders it): 11 -> 13. loop.c
 *     still hoists it to 0x80057384, and the rotation is UNCHANGED -- an
 *     explicit variable and a loop-hoisted temp score identically. It also
 *     shows the target's srl-before-sll needs the two-statement form
 *     (`bits = raw_bits >> 8; bits |= raw_bits << 8;`); the fused expression
 *     flips the operand order.
 *   - tools/autorules.py: no improving edit among 73 candidates.
 *   - tools/permute.py, bounded 300s -j4 --stop-on-zero: no improvement.
 *
 * ROUND 2 (base re-verified: 11/1076, matches this file's STATUS exactly).
 * Re-ran the ladder end to end (reghist, autorules, ONE bounded permuter,
 * cc1says, regalloc --order/--compare, rtlguide, autorules --guided) and
 * closed the "premise is wrong" gap the previous park flagged, without
 * finding a lever:
 *   - reghist: delta sum 0, only $a1/$t0 counts differ (+4/-4) -- confirms
 *     pure-rotation, not a mega-pseudo; consistent with the diagnosis above.
 *   - tools/autorules.py: re-run fresh, 0 of 63 (ruleset has not grown a
 *     lever for this shape since the last park).
 *   - tools/autorules.py --guided (rtlguide's mechanical search, which adds
 *     regalloc-specific rules absent from the plain sweep -- loop-fence,
 *     nested-loop-fence, paired-loop-fence, disjoint-local-alias,
 *     allocation-donor-fence, deferred-global-capture, shared-result-return):
 *     0 of 160 compiled candidates.
 *   - tools/permute.py, bounded 240s -j4 --stop-on-zero: 17831 iterations,
 *     authoritative rescore still base.c at 11/11/1076. Two independent
 *     bounded runs (this one and the prior 300s run) now agree: not
 *     permuter-reachable, not a crashed/short search either.
 *   - THE CONFLICT GRAPH (dump_conflicts, global.c:1666-1676, printed BEFORE
 *     coloring -- the STATIC interference graph, not a priority number):
 *     col/font/bits/v mutually conflict (a full 4-clique), but fill_white
 *     conflicts with v ONLY -- it does NOT conflict with col, font, or bits.
 *     This means fill_white's own register is decided entirely by ITS OTHER
 *     roommates-of-roommates (p197/p196/p193 block a0-a3 for it indirectly;
 *     p98 or a LOCAL pseudo blocks $t0), never by a direct fight with
 *     col/font/bits. It also means the required order is a strict
 *     tournament over the 4-clique -- bits, font, v, col MUST be colored in
 *     that exact relative order to land (a1,a2,a3,t0), full stop; there is
 *     no partial-order slack to exploit.
 *   - regalloc.py --compare/--between (independent confirmation of the
 *     priority-table arithmetic above, via the tool rather than by hand):
 *     `p179 > p87` needs +5 weighted refs (matches "n_refs >= 12" exactly).
 *     `p85 > p86` (i.e. col dropping below v) needs col to shed only 1
 *     weighted ref (16->15 crosses the floor_log2 4->3 cliff, 21333->15000).
 *     But shedding col ALONE is insufficient and moves the WRONG variable
 *     into $a1: with col demoted, font becomes first-processed in the
 *     4-clique and takes $a1 itself (verified by hand-simulating the
 *     4-clique in priority order) -- bits, font and col do not have
 *     independent levers; only the bits-vs-font gap actually gates the
 *     rotation, and font can shed at most ~2 refs (19->17, priority 15813)
 *     before it would drop below v and swap ITS OWN register with v's --
 *     so the effective combined budget is still ~+5 weighted refs, however
 *     split. Given loop 1's instructions are already exact, every such
 *     mention is forced by a real instruction (flow.c:1969/2404: REG_N_REFS
 *     += loop_depth per actual SET/USE rtx in the final RTL) -- there is no
 *     "free" mention CSE won't fold away before reg-scan runs.
 *   - find_reg's preference mechanism (global.c:900-1037, read via
 *     tools/ccsrc.py rather than recalled): `hard_reg_copy_preferences` /
 *     `hard_reg_preferences` can only PROMOTE a pseudo to a DIFFERENT
 *     register that is already outside `used` (i.e. still legitimately
 *     available to it) -- it can never override a real conflict-based
 *     exclusion. bits has zero recorded preferences (no "179 preferences:"
 *     line in the raw .greg dump), consistent with crossing 0 calls in loop
 *     1. This closes off preference-based promotion as a second lever, not
 *     just the priority-race one the previous park already ruled out.
 *   - Retested the ONE verified lever (dropping `final_u = fill_white`) with
 *     a CLEAN substitution (`*pixel = fill_white;` directly, not leaving
 *     final_u read uninitialized) to make sure the prior 11->33 wasn't an
 *     artifact of a botched edit: reproduces 11->33 exactly. Reading the
 *     allocation after this edit shows the mechanism is NOT what the prior
 *     note guessed -- fill_white does not cleanly move to $t1; instead bits
 *     and fill_white COLLAPSE onto the SAME register ($t0, legally, since
 *     they don't conflict), col is still wrong in $a1, and a new 12-insn/
 *     16-byte cluster opens at the GetTPage tail (0x800575e8-0x80057628)
 *     where final_u's other, unrelated use lives. Confirms this edit is a
 *     genuine dead end, not a near-miss.
 *   - tools/rtlguide.py surfaces one loose thread for the next lane: its
 *     register-goal summary for $t0<->$t1 lists THREE priority figures
 *     (9500, 6750, 6666), not the two accounted for above (fill_white=9500,
 *     the unrelated p98=6750) -- there is a third contender at priority
 *     ~6666 this park has not identified (likely a LOCAL allocno under
 *     local-alloc's different quantity-ordering formula, e.g. a roommate of
 *     p356/t0, since global-alloc's 25-allocno table has no entry at 6666).
 *     Not chased further this round; may or may not matter to the rotation.
 *
 * Net: two independently-run lanes, via different methods (hand priority
 * arithmetic vs tool-driven conflict-graph + preference-mechanism reading),
 * now agree the bits-vs-font ordering is the single gating constraint, that
 * closing it costs ~5 weighted refs with no free source of them, and that
 * neither the plain nor guided mechanical sweep nor two bounded permuter
 * runs (300s, 240s) find a way around it. Still park-worthy, not proven
 * mathematically impossible (a restructuring outside this park's 5-variable
 * framing could exist), but the priority-race framing itself is no longer
 * an open question -- only a from-scratch alternate decomposition remains
 * unexplored, and it risks the already-exact instruction sequence.
 *
 * ROUND 3 (11 -> 9; base re-verified 11/1076 before starting). The trigger:
 * master fixed permute.py's cc1 invocation today -- `-fno-builtin` had been in
 * its CPP list (where it does nothing) and absent from CC_FLAGS, so every
 * permuter run before today's fix compiled WITH builtins enabled while the
 * real build (and this function calls `memset`, a builtin-expandable name)
 * compiles WITHOUT them. Both of ROUND 2's permuter negatives (300s, 240s)
 * were against that wrong program and are VOID. A fresh bounded run on the
 * corrected permuter was genuinely warranted, and it found a real win:
 *   - `timeout 240 tools/permute.py SetupTelop -- --stop-on-zero -j4`:
 *     authoritative full-link rescore found output-40-1/source.c at 9/9/1076
 *     (vs base.c 11/11/1076). The candidate is pycparser-reprinted (all
 *     declarations re-split, 2-space indent) so the raw diff is ~100 lines of
 *     formatting noise; the SEMANTIC delta vs base.c is exactly two edits:
 *       (a) `n += 2; if (telop[n] == 0) break;` -> `if ((telop[n]==0)&0xFFFFu)`
 *       (b) tail: `TelopP.u3 = final_u; TelopP.u1 = final_u;` ->
 *           `TelopP.u3 = (north = final_u); TelopP.u1 = north;` (routes the
 *           SECOND read through the already-dead outline-loop local `north`
 *           instead of re-reading `final_u`).
 *   - Isolated each edit by hand-porting into the real source (not the
 *     permuter's own score) and re-measuring with matchdiff on a full
 *     rebuild: (a) ALONE is a no-op, still 11 (the AND is a value no-op --
 *     `bool & 0xFFFF` never changes bit 0 -- and this cc1 folds it away
 *     completely; length stayed 1076 both ways, confirming no real `andi` was
 *     emitted). (b) ALONE reaches 9 -- the whole win is the `north` reuse.
 *     Ported cleanly (no pycparser artifacts) and confirmed via
 *     `NON_MATCHING=SetupTelop ./Build` + `tools/matchdiff.py -n`: 9/9/1076.
 *   - Tried a cleaner human alternative before adopting the odd-looking
 *     `north` reuse: chained assignment `TelopP.u3 = TelopP.u1 = final_u;`.
 *     Measured WORSE (13, and it also reverses the u3/u1 store order vs
 *     target) -- old cc1 does not evaluate a chained assignment as "read the
 *     RHS once, write both fields"; rejected per the cookbook's "worse byte
 *     count adopted" rule (docs/matching-cookbook.md, human-source lever).
 *   - Tried a FRESH temp instead of reusing `north` (`s32 final_u2 = final_u;
 *     TelopP.u3 = final_u2; TelopP.u1 = final_u2;`, a brand-new never-before-
 *     seen pseudo). This reproduces the ORIGINAL 11-byte 3-way rotation
 *     EXACTLY (same addresses, same registers) -- i.e. a fresh temp is a
 *     complete no-op for this lever. This sharpens cookbook §3.9's existing
 *     "reusing a dead named local for the operand" rule with a measured
 *     negative control: the win requires reusing an EXISTING, previously-live
 *     pseudo specifically (gcc-2.8.1 has no coalescing pass, so a copy
 *     between two non-conflicting allocnos can let one inherit bookkeeping/
 *     pressure the other already carries; a same-shaped copy into a pseudo
 *     that never existed before carries none of that).
 *   - Mechanism (via regalloc.py --order + ground-truth .combine RTL, not
 *     guessed): the `north` reuse resolves fill_white cleanly to $t1 (two
 *     whole instructions -- the `li t1,0x7fff` and `sh t1,0(v0)` -- now match
 *     target byte-for-byte), collapsing the OLD 3-way col/bits/fill_white
 *     rotation into a CLEAN 2-way col<->bits swap. This happens through
 *     GLOBAL register-pressure bookkeeping: the new tail code introduces one
 *     new short-lived, high-priority allocno (9 refs / 3 live -> priority
 *     90000, pref=$t0 -- confirmed via `.combine`'s insn 882/886/891 at C
 *     lines 380-381, i.e. genuinely this new code, not a pre-existing
 *     pseudo), and its presence in the global qsort order changes which
 *     registers are already-taken by the time fill_white is colored, even
 *     though fill_white's own textual position (deep in loop 1, long before
 *     the tail) never moves. Loop 1 itself is untouched instruction-for-
 *     instruction (confirmed: rebuilt asm for the col/bits/font/v region is
 *     byte-identical before and after this edit).
 *   - RE-SEEDED the permuter from the new 9-byte checkpoint (protocol: a
 *     shrunk residual opens a neighbourhood the old search never saw):
 *     `timeout 240 tools/permute.py SetupTelop -- --stop-on-zero -j4` again,
 *     18686 iterations, authoritative rescore still base.c at 9/9/1076. No
 *     further improvement in this bounded window.
 *   - tools/autorules.py, re-run fresh on the 9-byte state: 0 of 63 improving
 *     candidates.
 *   - tools/autorules.py --guided, re-run fresh: 0 of 160 compiled candidates
 *     (self-bounded budget reached, not the 420s deadline).
 *   - tools/regalloc.py SetupTelop --compare 179 87 --enclosed-refs 3
 *     (bits=p179 vs font=p87), re-run on the NEW 9-byte draft: reports the
 *     IDENTICAL "+5 weighted ref(s)" gap, and --order shows col=p86 (16/30,
 *     21333), font=p87 (19/43, 17674), v=p85 (35/111, 15765), bits=p179
 *     (7/19, 7368) all UNCHANGED to the integer from ROUND 2's numbers. This
 *     independently confirms loop 1's own internal tournament math is
 *     completely untouched by the tail fix -- the fill_white win was entirely
 *     a global-pressure side effect, not a change to the col/font/bits/v
 *     sub-problem, which remains exactly the hard tournament ROUND 2 proved.
 *   - tools/rtlguide.py on the new state names the two remaining hunks'
 *     locals as "u,north" for the $t0->$a1 direction -- this is a MISLEAD;
 *     ground-truth `.combine` tracing (grep the pre-allocation RTL for the
 *     pseudo feeding the `srav` at C line 307, insn 368: `(ashiftrt (reg 179)
 *     (reg 168))`) shows it is bits (reg 179, fed directly into the srav) and
 *     its sign-extension companion, NOT the source-level locals `u` or
 *     `north` (neither is even in scope at that point in the loop -- `u` is
 *     uninitialized until after this loop closes, `north` isn't touched until
 *     the tail). rtlguide's local-name attribution can mislabel an anonymous
 *     compiler-synthesized sign-extension temp; its structural HARD-CONFLICT
 *     signal is still sound, just cite priority numbers over its names when
 *     they don't match a plausible live variable. Also identified the
 *     "p92" it names as the hard-conflict partner: that IS the new `north`-
 *     reuse pseudo this round introduced (confirmed via `.combine`), and it
 *     does NOT conflict with col (disjoint live ranges, checked against the
 *     `;; 86 conflicts:` list) -- col's actual blocker remains bits itself,
 *     via the real, unavoidable 4-clique conflict ROUND 2 already established.
 *
 * Net: a genuine, verified 11->9 improvement banked (the `north`-reuse tail
 * edit, cookbook §3.9's dead-local-reuse lever, now with a measured negative
 * control proving a fresh temp does NOT reproduce it). The remaining col-vs-
 * bits 2-way swap is the SAME hard-pinned tournament ROUND 2 proved needs +5
 * weighted refs with no free source, now independently reconfirmed on the
 * post-fix draft via both the regalloc.py tool AND a hand ground-truth RTL
 * trace (this round), with the same "not proven mathematically impossible,
 * but no lever found" verdict. Re-seeded permuter, fresh plain + guided
 * autorules all agree. Next lane: the only unexplored thread is a from-
 * scratch alternate decomposition of the col/bits sub-expressions themselves
 * (not ref-shedding, not permuting) -- ROUND 2's "third contender ~6666"
 * loose thread is believed MOOT (it was about the old 3-way t0<->t1 puzzle,
 * which this round's fix resolved by a different mechanism), but was not
 * re-chased to confirm.
 *
 * ROUND 4 (base re-verified 9/1076 before + after). Task steered here with a
 * NEW tool (`tools/regalloc.py --local`, built for a presumed "local-alloc
 * tie") and a claim the permuter/regalloc `-fno-builtin` bug postdated ROUND 3.
 * Chased all three; the "local-alloc tie" classification is a MISDIAGNOSIS and
 * the tie is exactly the GLOBAL one ROUND 2/3 proved. New results:
 *   - tools/regalloc.py --local: SELF-VALIDATED (simulated assignment
 *     reproduced ALL 125 of cc1's printed `;; Register N in M` local homes, 0
 *     divergences), so its model is trustworthy -- and col/font/bits/v are NOT
 *     in the local walk at all. They appear only in --order (global) as
 *     p86/p87/p85/p179, and the tool's own "LOCAL-ONLY (local_alloc coloured
 *     these -- global_alloc never saw them)" list EXCLUDES them. No loop-1
 *     block has ANY local pseudo homed to $a1 or $t0 (loop locals are all
 *     v0/v1/a0). So there is NO local-alloc ref-weight lever: the 4-clique is
 *     colored by GLOBAL alloc, precisely the pinned tournament already proved.
 *     The tool AGREES with the header's hand-derived global answer by showing
 *     the flip is not even a local-alloc question.
 *   - the `-fno-builtin` fix IS now in regalloc.py's CC_FLAGS (its comment even
 *     names SetupTelop's memset). Re-ran --order on the corrected tool: col
 *     p86=16/30/21333, font p87=19/43/17674, v p85=35/111/15765, bits
 *     p179=7/19/7368 -- IDENTICAL to ROUND 3 to the integer. The builtin fix
 *     opens no new door for this tie (memset is in the tail; loop-1 refs are
 *     unaffected).
 *   - fresh bounded permuter on the corrected toolchain
 *     (`timeout 240 tools/permute.py SetupTelop -- --stop-on-zero -j4`): 17938
 *     iterations, authoritative full-link rescore still base.c 9/9/1076. Third
 *     independent plateau (with ROUND 2/3).
 *   - human-source addressing restructures (lever #3, NOT tried by prior
 *     rounds): `bitmap[v][15-col]` -> LENGTH 1088; explicit hoisted row pointer
 *     `row=bitmap[v]; row[15-col]` -> LENGTH 1084. Both WORSE. The byte-offset
 *     cast form `pixel=(s16*)((u8*)bitmap+((15-col)*2+v*0x20))` is load-bearing:
 *     the compiler's own strength-reduction makes the row-base GIV ($a0),
 *     matching the target; an explicit `row` pseudo is NOT that GIV and inflates
 *     the frame. Neither form touches the col/bits registers regardless.
 *   - SHARPER "why no global-pressure lever" (this is what ROUND 3's fill_white
 *     fix could exploit but col/bits cannot): bits is loop-INVARIANT, hoisted by
 *     loop.c to the col-loop preheader, so its live range STRICTLY CONTAINS
 *     col's (col is born at `col=0` inside the loop, dies at loop exit; bits is
 *     live from the preheader through the same exit). Therefore NO third allocno
 *     can conflict with col yet not bits -- any range overlapping col overlaps
 *     bits. So col and bits can NEVER be register-separated by an a1-occupying
 *     pressure allocno (the ROUND 3 mechanism); their assignment is fixed purely
 *     by relative PRIORITY, and lower-priority-of-the-clique takes the higher
 *     reg. col(21333) > bits(7368) => col colored first => col=$a1, bits=$t0,
 *     full stop. Contrast fill_white, which ROUND 2 showed conflicts with v
 *     ONLY (not the clique) -- that is exactly why fill_white WAS movable by
 *     global pressure and col/bits are not. To flip needs bits to outrank col:
 *     bits +5 weighted refs AND col shed to <=7 refs (-9), both pinned by the
 *     exact-matching insn sequence. This tightens "not proven impossible" to
 *     "unreachable by any conflict/pressure trick; only a from-scratch loop-1
 *     RTL that re-weights col/bits WITHOUT changing the final instructions could
 *     do it, and no such source is known." Still parked at 9.
 *   - CLEANED the ROUND 3 tail win per lever #3 (prefer human structure, reject
 *     scaffolding) at NO byte cost. ROUND 3 routed final_u through `north` (the
 *     outline loop's Y-neighbour pixel local) -- semantically nonsense, pure
 *     byte-chase. The §3.9 mechanism only needs a PREVIOUSLY-LIVE local as the
 *     carrier; `u` (a real PSX.SYM local, and literally the U texture coordinate
 *     being computed) is such a local and is the natural human choice. Rewrote
 *     the tail as `u = (u16)rect.x - 0x301; TelopP.u3 = u; TelopP.u1 = u;`
 *     (dropping the redundant final_u indirection too) -- measured 9/9/1076,
 *     byte-identical residual (col/bits only), fill_white still correct in $t1.
 *     So the 11->9 win is now carried by faithful source, not a fence: reusing
 *     the U-coord variable to store the U coord. (final_u remains the col-loop
 *     white carrier; that role is unchanged.) NEW cookbook refinement to §3.9:
 *     when a dead-local-reuse carrier is needed, prefer the SEMANTICALLY CORRECT
 *     previously-live local (here the U-coordinate `u`) over an arbitrary one --
 *     any previously-live local supplies the pressure, so pick the human one.
