/*
 * GetItemType (0x8004a3e8, 0x44 bytes) — linear-search the global item pool
 * `items[]` (item.h's proven tag_TItem; 30 slots, the same bound
 * ClearItemLayout.c uses) for the slot whose `locate->id` (ModelType.id)
 * matches ConflictID, returning that slot's `type`. Falls back to
 * ITEM_KIND_2_KAGINAWA if none of the 30 slots match before the count runs
 * out. `i` counts iterations in $a1, `p` walks `items` in $v1; i's increment
 * is the first body statement (falls into the mismatch branch's delay slot)
 * and p's advance is the last (the back-branch's delay slot).
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - This LOOKS like a "guard clause with two returns" (Ghidra: `if (match)
 *    return type; ...keep searching...; return FALLBACK;`), which the
 *    cookbook's null-guard exception says to keep in Ghidra's literal
 *    polarity. That's wrong here and relocates the match-return to the far
 *    end of the function (past the fallback), because the "rest" arm
 *    contains the loop's OWN back-edge (`goto loop`) — cc1 keeps the code
 *    lexically AFTER the if as the inline fallthrough and relocates the
 *    if-body, regardless of which side is the "guard". Fix: invert the
 *    condition and NEST the keep-searching-and-fall-back logic inside the
 *    if, leaving the found-return as the final, unnested statement — see the
 *    refined rule added to the cookbook's Dispatch section.
