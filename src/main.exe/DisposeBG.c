 * null-check-then-free shape as DisposeAfterimage/DisposeMotionManager, one
 * more field. Ghidra renders the first free as `vfree(&bg->cell->u)` (a
 * union-address artifact of its GsBG/GsMAP struct nesting), but the raw .s
 * is a plain `lw $a0, 0x34($s0)` — a field LOAD, not an address computation
 * — so trust m2c's flat `vfree(arg0->unk34)` reading instead. Local
 * truncated view (pad to the first freed offset, `void *` fields) rather
 * than importing Ghidra's full nested GsBG/GsMAP, unused elsewhere in the
 * codebase (same convention as AfterimageType in ReqItemHappou/ReqItemLaunch).
