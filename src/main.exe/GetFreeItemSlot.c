/*
 * GetFreeItemSlot (0x8004a42c) — allocate a free slot from items[] via the same
 * round-robin counter as ReqItemDrop (COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_): if the slot
 * the counter lands on is free (proc == 0) it's returned immediately;
 * otherwise the counter advances and retries up to 0x1d times, and if the
 * whole pool stays busy the slot the counter last landed on is force-disposed
 * (identical dispose sequence to ReqItemDrop/ProcItemManebue: run its proc
 * with mode=0xff, delete the conflict, complain if mode didn't clear, then
 * clear owner/proc) and returned anyway.
 *
 * No caller for this function exists anywhere in the retail image (checked:
 * no `jal` and no raw address reference anywhere in main.exe, and none of
 * Ghidra's decompilation of every other function references it either) —
 * dead code kept for byte-identical reproduction, most likely an unused
 * standalone allocator superseded by ReqItemDrop's inlined copy of the same
 * logic.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - Same do-while shape as ReqItemDrop (`i = 0;` first, since there's no
 *    parameter to cache ahead of it here), but the early exit is
 *    `if (it->proc == 0) return it;` rather than `goto found;`: with no
 *    drop-specific code after the loop, cc1 emits the return-value move in
 *    the branch's own delay slot instead of falling into shared code.
