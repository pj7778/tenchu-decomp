/*
 * PauseProc (0x8004b4c0) — the in-game pause loop. Entered every frame;
 * Start (or a dead player, FUN_8001b174 == 0) raises the pause flag
 * (SystemFlag bit 4), then this spins: polling the pad, feeding new presses
 * to the combo matcher (0x10 = revive cheat, 0x1000 = debug enable) and the
 * cheat-code recorder, Select opening the debug menu when debug is enabled,
 * Start unpausing, and DrawPause/VSync ticking the frame counter.
 *
 * Matching notes (all verified against the original bytes):
 *  - All pad state is s16 (pad/cur/opad/trg): the plain `opad != 0` test
 *    compiles to sll+beqz (sign-extension with the sra dropped for a zero
 *    test) — u16 vars would emit andi 0xffff. Likewise buf must be SIGNED
 *    s16[]: the 0xffff terminator store materializes as the HImode-canonical
 *    `li -1` (addiu) only for a signed element; a u16 element gives
 *    `ori 0xffff` (one byte off).
 *  - trg is computed fresh ($s1, feeds only the combo-call argument) and then
 *    copied into opad (`opad = trg;`, $s2) which the rest of the body reads:
 *    two registers holding one value = an explicit source copy (cc1 never
 *    splits live ranges).
 *  - `cur == 0x900` and the call argument share one sign-extension of cur,
 *    CSE'd into callee-saved $s0 because it lives across FUN_800566fc().
 *  - com is int, not short: the combo matcher's short return is extended
 *    once at the assignment (sll/sra straight into $a1, before the
 *    status==7/mid>0x713 override) and both == compares then run on the word.
 *    A short com would re-extend at the compares, after the join.
 *  - Every exit path `break`s and SsSetMVol(0x7f,0x7f) is written ONCE after
 *    the loop: the after-loop block is entered by fallthrough and reorg
 *    steals its `li a0,0x7f` into the three break-jumps' empty delay slots
 *    (.L810 pattern); the revive path's slot is taken by the pad.data sh, so
 *    it jumps to the li itself (.L80C). Writing the call in each path
 *    cross-jumps less (the arg li gets scheduled away from the call and the
 *    suffixes stop matching) — +6 instructions.
 *  - `cur = pad;` sits before `SkipFrame = 2;` — its move is what reorg puts
 *    in the pause-flag beqz delay slot.
 *  - The recorder increments through a short temp BEFORE the call:
 *    `j = i + 1; i = j; CheckCheatCodes(buf, j + 1);` reproduces
 *    `addiu a1,s7,1; addu s7,a1; …` with a1 dead at the call. Ghidra's order
 *    (call, then i = i + 1) sends the shared i+1 pseudo across the call into
 *    a callee-saved reg with a post-call move (the scheduler never hoists
 *    across calls); `i = i + 1;` first + `(short)i + 1` collapses to an
 *    in-place addiu, one insn short. The narrow adds stay raw (HImode) while
 *    buf's indexes reuse the bound-check's sign-extension (v1).
 *  - &CamState and buf are hoisted into $s4/$s5 by loop.c (while(1) keeps
 *    loop notes — no source temps); CamState.Owner is re-read at every use
 *    and the sh through Owner->life kills cse's memory equivalence, which is
 *    exactly the original's reload pattern.
 *  - The unpause wait is the cookbook's top-test shape:
 *    while(1) { if (!(GetRealPad(0) & 0x800)) break; VSync(2); }.
