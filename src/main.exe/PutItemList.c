/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 8 of 504 bytes differ (2 whole instructions short;
 * whole-image count equals the window count once earlier functions in the
 * batch are fixed, so this is the function's OWN residual, not drift).
 *
 * PutItemList (0x8004ade4, 0x1F8 bytes) — draws the shop/inventory item
 * list: for each of the 25 item kinds (`CamState.Owner->item[i]`, the
 * per-kind carry count — item.h's Humanoid.item[0x1A]@0xB4, NOT PSX.SYM's
 * stale 0xA8), if the count is nonzero draws a right-to-left digit strip
 * (same NumberImage idiom as PutNumber.c/PutLifeBar.c, same TU) unless the
 * count is the 0xFF "unlimited" sentinel, then places the item icon sprite
 * (`D_8008E5BC[i]`, PutItemIcon.c's proven `ItemIconType`) — brighter/
 * highlighted with the moving cursor sprite if `i` is the currently
 * selected kind (`CURRENTLY_SELECTED_ITEM_KIND_1_`), dimmer otherwise.
 * `CURRENTLY_SELECTED_ITEM_KIND_0_` records which slot actually got drawn
 * selected this frame (reset to -1 up front).
 *
 * The digit loop is the same hand-rolled goto as PutNumber/PutLifeBar (the
 * /10 magic constant re-materializes every iteration in the target rather
 * than hoisting — a real do/while would let loop.c hoist it to a preheader).
 * The outer item loop IS a real loop (top-test + unconditional back-jump,
 * the `while(1){if(!cond)break;...}` shape): `&NumberImage`/`&CursorImage`
 * hoist to the very top of the function (computed once, outside the loop)
 * exactly as loop.c's invariant motion would do for a real loop, matching
 * the target's prologue setting up $s1/$s6 before the loop even starts.
 *
 * `s` (PSX.SYM: a genuine separate `unsigned int`, not just `i`) is the
 * BYTE offset into `D_8008E5BC[]` (+=4 per iteration, parallel to `i`'s
 * +=1) — a second explicit counter alongside `i`, not `D_8008E5BC[i]`
 * re-multiplied each time.
 *
 * Residual (root-caused): both branches of the `KIND_1_ == i` test compute
 * the identical `D_8008E5BC + s` address (confirmed byte-identical in the
 * TARGET too — it's NOT hoisted there, each branch pays for its own
 * lui+addiu). In THIS draft, reorg recognizes the shared `lui
 * %hi(D_8008E5BC)` as valid in the branch's own delay slot (executes
 * unconditionally either way) and reuses it for both arms — 2 real
 * instructions cheaper than the target, which instead fills that delay
 * slot with the final shared call's `move a2,zero` (a DIFFERENT, otherwise
 * redundant, dependency-free candidate). Tried and did not change the
 * winner: reordering the `ic=...`/cursor-field statements, a `do{}while(0)`
 * around the selected-branch tail, and hoisting an explicit early `pri`
 * local for the final call's 3rd argument. This is a delay-slot-filler
 * PRIORITY tie between two independent, dependency-free candidates — same
 * family as the cookbook's named guard-delay-slot-fill tie, just between
 * two ordinary candidates instead of a guard's own return-value setup.
