/*
 * GetHumanoid (0x8002946c, 0x70 bytes) — linear-search the live HumanGroup[]
 * pointer array (length Humans) for the first entry whose `type` field
 * (item.h's Humanoid.type @0x00) matches `type`, returning that pointer (or
 * 0 if none). Same "Humanoid control" TU as
 * is_character_state_present_on_stage_.c/GetDirection.c/MoveHumanoid.c
 * (address-contiguous; is_character_state_present_on_stage_ sits immediately
 * after this function at 0x800294dc and shares HumanGroup/Humans).
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - The loop counter `i` is `short`, NOT `int` like the sibling
 *    is_character_state_present_on_stage_'s `s32 i` (which strength-reduces
 *    HumanGroup[i] to a walking +4 pointer). A short index instead
 *    recomputes the array byte-offset every iteration via a FUSED
 *    sign-extend+scale shift pair (`sll $v0,i,16` / `sra $v0,$v0,14`) —
 *    this is the natural single-shift result of a HImode induction variable
 *    scaled by a pointer's 4-byte stride, distinct from the GetPad-class
 *    "no natural C form" idiom (that one splits a PURE sign-extend across
 *    two sra's with no scale folded in at all; this one folds scale AND
 *    extend into one op, which plain `arr[short_i]` produces directly).
 *  - `type` (the short parameter) is sign-extended once, hoisted above the
 *    loop (compared every iteration against the loop-invariant value).
 *  - Standard entry-duplicated for-loop shape (cookbook Loops): the `i=0 <
 *    Humans` initial test is hoisted to the top (`Humans <= 0` -> return 0),
 *    the real per-iteration test rotates to the bottom.
