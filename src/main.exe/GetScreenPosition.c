 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:

/*
 * GetScreenPosition (0x800396c0, 0x9c bytes) — camera-relative coordinate
 * transform + perspective project: zeroes the GTE scratchpad MATRIX's
 * translation vector (fixed PS1 scratchpad RAM at 0x1F800000, same
 * `MATRIX *m` idiom as PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c's t[0..2] @ 0x14/0x18/0x1c), writes
 * (x,y,z) - ViewInfo.(vpx,vpy,vpz) into a scratchpad SVECTOR @ 0x1F800020
 * (same idiom as the twin FUN_80039610.c's sv @ 0x1F800080), installs the
 * (all-zero) translation and the global world-space rotation matrix
 * GsWSMATRIX, then calls RotTransPers (GTE perspective-transform library
 * wrapper, 0x80078704 > 0x80060000, precompiled) with that SVECTOR, the
 * caller's own output pointer arg3 (passed through unmodified), and two more
 * scratchpad slots (+0x28/+0x2c). RotTransPers's returned OTZ (depth) is
 * written to arg3's second word (`arg3[1]`, i.e. +4 bytes) — identical tail
 * to the twin.
 *
 * ViewInfo.vpx/vpy/vpz: item.h-style proven TViewInfo fields (s32, matching
 * Ghidra's own independently-built GsRVIEW2 — see ReqItemDefault.c/
 * FUN_80039610.c). SetTransMatrix/SetRotMatrix each take a single MATRIX*
 * (PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c proves both signatures); the OTHER a-registers still
 * holding values at those call sites are leftover from the adjacent
 * sv->vy/vz stores, not real arguments — m2c over-counts both calls'
 * argument lists by reading those live regs as args.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `arg0 - (short)ViewInfo.vpx` is a NARROWING use (the result stores into
 *    a scratchpad s16 field) of a s32 global's LOW HALF — cc1 emits `lhu`
 *    for it, same rule as the twin.
 *  - Raw scratchpad addresses are plain integer-literal pointer casts,
 *    never a shared "Scratchpad + offset" symbol (PrepareGetScreenPositionS.c/
 *    FUN_80039610.c precedent).
