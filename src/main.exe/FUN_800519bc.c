/* STATUS: NON_MATCHING — complete pure-C reconstruction at the exact target
 * length (1448 bytes / 362 instructions). The guarded draft differs in 76 linked
 * bytes (down from 118), across 28 aligned instruction lines.
 * KEY FINDING: the `do{sequence=0;}while(0)` fence was NOT load-bearing — it walled
 * off the basic block sched2 needs in order to interleave the callee-saved register
 * spills with the init writes; removing it (plain `sequence = 0;`) let the saves
 * interleave as retail does and closed 25 bytes on its own. Moving `fade_step = -8`
 * to just after the first PathFileRead lets it fill that call's branch delay slot.
 * Both position narrowings are now explicit in-place shifts (`position <<= 16;
 * position >>= 16;` and `position = counter << 16; position >>= 16;`) so the
 * sign-extend is `sll s0,s0,16; sra s0,s0,16` in place of a v0 scratch.
 * Retained: snapshotting old_pad before its write (delay slot), the distinct
 * full-word tpage capture (lw/nop/sra), capturing the call result/xbase before
 * their stores. LOAD-BEARING (confirmed by regression on removal): the outer strip
 * `do{}while(0)` (length mismatch without it) and the nested position-carrier
 * fences (regress to 100).
 * REMAINING (all greg register/schedule ties, no source lever found; rejected:
 * single-expr scroll=128, tpage/xbase var-merge, `3*x`):
 * (1) prologue — the prefix/s2 setup schedules after the sequence/fade spills
 * instead of first, and the two init constants land in v0 where retail reuses t0
 * (xbase materialized 0xff60/ori vs retail -160/addiu); (2) four caller-saved ties
 * where retail reuses t0 for load temps (tpage_word->a2, xbase_value->v1,
 * scroll-adjusted->a2) and v1 for the brightness `0xa0-position` intermediate (->v0)
 * — rtlguide hard-conflicts a2->v0 (p89/p96/p197), v0->v1 (p82); (3) position=counter's
 * in-place sign-extend is scheduled two insns before the GetTPage(0,0) arg moves.
 * Fuzzy: 94.48% (up from 90.88%).
 * ROUND 2 (fresh, skeptical re-verification of the above — all CONFIRMED, not
 * refuted): tools/autorules.py unguided (73 candidates) and --guided off a fresh
 * rtlguide run (160 candidates, budget-capped beam) both report no improving
 * edit; tools/permute.py (-j4, 16457 iterations, stop-on-zero) plateaus exactly
 * at 87 with zero candidates beating base.c. Four NEW hypotheses tested and
 * REJECTED (each rebuilt+remeasured, not just reasoned):
 * - `xbase` as `s16` (to get retail's `addiu -160` instead of `ori 0xff60` per
 *   the addiu/ori-names-the-type rule): regresses 87->1464. Root cause read off
 *   the objdump: cc1's CSE now recognises the signed -160 constant as the SAME
 *   value as the later `sprite.x = -0xa0;` (also genuinely -160 in target) and
 *   merges them into ONE persistent value, promoted to a callee-saved register
 *   (`li s3,-160` + an extra spill) to survive the 6 intervening calls — even
 *   though TARGET keeps these two materialisations separate (t0 early, v0 late,
 *   never merged) despite being the identical constant. Whatever makes retail
 *   avoid that merge is not reproduced by simply signing the constant.
 * - Same constant via a two-step signed local (`s16 xbase_init = -0xa0; stack.xbase
 *   = xbase_init;`, field left `u16`): identical regression to 1464, same root
 *   cause (the local still carries -160 as a signed SImode constant that CSE
 *   coalesces with sprite.x's).
 * - Replacing every `PSTATE->stage`/`PSTATE->language` in this function with the
 *   named externs `CHOSEN_STAGE`/`CHOSEN_LANGUAGE` (used elsewhere in this file
 *   for CHOSEN_CHARACTER/STAGE_LAYOUT_NUMBER, and pervasively in StageEndScreen/
 *   mission_score_screen): regresses 87->1488. cc1 cannot fold two INDEPENDENT
 *   extern symbol_refs' `%hi` together, so every use re-materialises its own
 *   lui+lbu instead of sharing one base register. CAUTION for future readers:
 *   the target .s file's own `%hi(CHOSEN_STAGE)` labels are NOT evidence of the
 *   source spelling — they are splat's disassembler matching the final computed
 *   address against the symbol table, and our baseline's `PSTATE->stage` access
 *   already produces BYTE-IDENTICAL bytes for that instruction (confirmed: it
 *   was never part of any diffed cluster). Do not re-attempt this lever without
 *   new evidence.
 * - Merging `adjusted = stack.scroll; adjusted += D_8008ECF8[lang][stage];` into
 *   one statement `adjusted = stack.scroll + D_8008ECF8[lang][stage];`: regresses
 *   87->97, same length, but DOES prove the two-statement split is a live,
 *   non-neutral lever for that hunk (load order changed) — just backwards from
 *   what's needed here. The reverse pairing (index loads merged some other way)
 *   was not tried; a future round could probe adjacent orderings of this hunk
 *   specifically (target: PSTATE->language/PSTATE->stage lbus BEFORE the
 *   `stack.scroll` reload, i.e. index computed before the reload it's added to).
 * rtlguide's "register goals" section (re-run fresh) shows the a2<->v0 and
 * v0<->v1 swaps are genuine HARD-CONFLICTs (cannot be reached by priority/weight
 * alone), but the four ->t0 goals (v0->t0 x4, a2->t0 x3, v1->t0 x2) carry NO
 * hard-conflict annotation — t0 is simply never tried by find_reg's numeric
 * search because a lower-numbered register is always free first. No source lever
 * was found this round to make t0 the winner; a future attempt should look for
 * what makes v0/v1/a2 UNAVAILABLE at those points in target (extend some other
 * value's live range to occupy them), not try to prefer t0 directly.
 * ROUND 3 (the 5 do{}while(0) fences audited one at a time — which are real,
 * which are ours): a macro search across every header AND every .c file's own
 * local #define in src/main.exe found NO function-like macro anywhere whose
 * body matches any of the 5 — the only do{}while(0)-shaped macros in this TU
 * family are DRAW_SCORE_NUMBER/DRAW_SCORE_COLON (mission_score_screen.c,
 * StageEndScreen.c), unrelated in shape and purpose. So none of the 5 are
 * macro hygiene by the letter of that test. Measured anyway, per-fence,
 * BOTH by hand (rebuilt+remeasured, one fence unwrapped at a time and in
 * combination) AND by `tools/autorules.py`'s independent `fence-unwrap` rule
 * (both agree exactly):
 *   - outer strip `do{ if(counter>=0){...} }while(0)` (L290): unwrapping it
 *     alone scores 87->1012 (autorules) — a de facto length mismatch, same
 *     conclusion as round 1's "length mismatch without it", now with an exact
 *     number. It wraps a REAL conditional block, not a bare statement — a
 *     plausible genuine "skip the rest of this case without goto" idiom. KEEP.
 *   - the three position-carrier wrappers around `position = signed_width -
 *     position;` (L307/L309/L311, nested 3 deep): unwrapping ANY ONE of them
 *     — even the innermost alone, even with the other two still wrapping it —
 *     scores 87->91, and unwrapping any subset (one, two, or all three) never
 *     scores worse OR better than 91: it is ONE dial, not three. Depth 3
 *     keeps tpage_value in s2 and signed_width in s1 (matching target);
 *     dropping below depth 3 flips the pair to s1/s2 swapped — a genuine
 *     local-alloc QTY_CMP_PRI tie, not a scheduling-order tie (the flat and
 *     fenced forms emit the IDENTICAL instruction sequence, only two register
 *     assignments swap).
 *   - `do{ sprite.tpage = tpage_result; }while(0)` (L318): unwrapped alone,
 *     87->93 — the single costliest fence, autorules-confirmed. Unwrapped
 *     TOGETHER with the other three (full flatten to 5 plain statements),
 *     the total is still only 91, i.e. its individual cost is absorbed once
 *     the other three are also gone (not additive — same 91 floor either way).
 *   CORRECTION to round 1: "the nested position-carrier fences (regress to
 *   100)" was measured against an earlier intermediate state of this file and
 *   is stale; the correct, freshly-measured number against the CURRENT source
 *   is 91 (any subset of the three) or 93 (tpage alone), never 100.
 *   A genuinely different, non-fence, non-flatten restructuring was also
 *   tried: folding the whole computation into one expression close to
 *   Ghidra's natural rendering (`xbase_value = stack.xbase; position =
 *   xbase_value - (signed_width - position) * 8; sprite.tpage =
 *   tpage_result;`) — this is WORSE (105), refuting the hypothesis that the
 *   5-statement decomposition through a reused `position` carrier is itself
 *   the byte-chased part; that decomposition is closer to target than the
 *   more "natural" single-expression alternative.
 *   PRECEDENT (same TU family): StageEndScreen.c has the identical pattern —
 *   `best_x = 0x80010000;` wrapped in FOUR nested do{}while(0) (its L498-510)
 *   with the comment "Preserve the target allocator weight for this reused
 *   identity", and its own STATUS header states verbatim: "The four nested
 *   do{}while(0) ... are LOAD-BEARING, measured: autorules' fence-unwrap
 *   scores each at 202->227. They are not scaffolding; do not remove them."
 *   That is this project's own established standard for exactly this
 *   situation: once a genuine macro search comes up empty, MEASURED
 *   NECESSITY — not textual macro provenance — decides whether a fence
 *   stays. This is NOT the SetWire / mission_score_screen situation (a worse
 *   byte count adopted because a genuinely BETTER, more complete alternative
 *   structure was found): here every alternative tried (flatten in every
 *   combination, single-expression fold) was strictly WORSE with no
 *   compensating gain in plausibility — there is no suppressed better
 *   structure to prefer, only an unresolved register-coloring tie the fences
 *   currently paper over. VERDICT: keep all 5 fences.
 *   Re-confirmed fresh: `tools/autorules.py` unguided (73 candidates,
 *   including all 5 fence-unwrap candidates individually) finds no improving
 *   edit; a bounded fresh permuter run (240s search + rescore, base score
 *   1095) never beats its own base score, consistent with round 2's
 *   16457-iteration run. No orphaned permuter state left behind.
 * ROUND 4 (re-verify with the -fno-builtin permute.py CC_FLAGS fix + hunt a
 * STRUCTURAL lever, per an owner directive that an 87B residual "hides a
 * missing/mis-shaped block"). RESULT: the structural premise is FALSIFIED and
 * 87 is re-confirmed as the hard floor.
 *   - CFG IS IDENTICAL: matchdiff/asmdiff show 362 vs 362 insns, no missing or
 *     extra branch, all 15 diff blocks are register renames + 2 local schedule
 *     swaps (prologue prefix-order, GetTPage(0,0) arg-move vs position sign-ext).
 *     There is no missing/mis-shaped block to find — the residual is genuinely
 *     sub-C register allocation (t0 numeric-order, the a2->v0/v0->v1 hard-conflicts).
 *   - FRESH permuter WITH the -fno-builtin fix (the reason this round exists):
 *     19444 iterations, -j4, --stop-on-zero. Authoritative full-link rescore:
 *     base.c 87 is best; every retained candidate rescores >=87 (output-860 has a
 *     BETTER proxy score 860 but rescores to 91). The fix changed nothing; the
 *     round-2/3 plateau claim stands.
 *   - autorules re-run (73 candidates) — no improving edit (unchanged).
 *   - NEW structural hypotheses tested & REJECTED (each rebuilt+remeasured):
 *     * index-first scroll (`adjusted = D_8008ECF8[..]; adjusted += stack.scroll;`
 *       — round 2's own "untried" suggestion): 87->102. The scroll-first split is
 *       optimal; the reverse pairing is worse, not better.
 *     * tpage_value as a direct `stack.tpage_base >> 16` OR a plain two-statement
 *       capture (dropping the identical-arm `if (strip_width!=0)`): LENGTH
 *       MISMATCH 1440 (-2 insns). That `if` is LOAD-BEARING: it is a control-flow
 *       merge that blocks cse's store->load forwarding of the prologue
 *       `stack.tpage_base = strip_px<<16;`, forcing the target's fresh lw/sra
 *       reload instead of reusing strip_px. Not scaffolding — it reconstructs a
 *       real target reload (cookbook "a redundant reload = a fresh dereference").
 *     * shared brightness intermediate (one `bright_base` var feeding both
 *       `(position+0xa0)*3` and `(0xa0-position)*3`): LENGTH MISMATCH 1436;
 *       cc1 merges the arms. Target keeps them separate (branch1 intermediate on
 *       v1, branch2 on v0 — the residual v0/v1 tie, a HARD-CONFLICT per rtlguide).
 *     * capturing the first PathFileRead 2nd arg into a local before the inits
 *       (to occupy v0 across the const materialisations, per round 2's hint):
 *       87->127; it hoists the whole index calc and reshuffles the prologue.
 *     * reorder `signed_width` birth before tpage + flatten the position-carriers
 *       (test whether birth-order gives target's s1/s2 without the fences):
 *       LENGTH MISMATCH 1452. Birth-order does NOT substitute for the loop_depth
 *       ref-weighting the nested fences provide.
 *   - FENCE VERDICT (owner asked to challenge them): the position-carrier nested
 *     do{}while(0) is the SAME matched technique as the matched sibling
 *     BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen (lever #3: "NESTED do{}while(0) (two
 *     deep)... each level adds +1 loop_depth to flow.c's ref weighting, flipping
 *     the {v0,v1} pairing"; lever #5: do{}while(0) carrier fences). That sibling
 *     matched at 0 WITH these. So the fences ARE "the human structure the matched
 *     sibling shows", not invented scaffolding — KEPT. `siblingdiff --demo` found
 *     no PSX.EXE sibling, but ROUND 5 found the renderer in demo/GAME.EXE.
 * ROUND 5 (compiler output first, with the earlier cookbook conclusions treated
 * as hypotheses): demo/GAME.EXE has a copy of this strip renderer at
 * 0x800431e0..0x80043344. Its data flow is ordinary human C: `u = counter * 4`,
 * `GetTPage(0, 0, (s16)tpage + counter, 0x100)`, an x position derived from
 * `(s16)width - counter`, and edge brightness `(160 - x) * 3`. Literal ports of
 * those expressions do not reproduce this build's allocation: the direct call
 * expression scores 83 bytes and the single x expression changes the length.
 * The pinned compiler's sched2 dump explains the four-byte call-order residual:
 * the sign-extension and a0/a1 argument setup are equal-ready UID choices; the
 * spelling that fixes their order also shortens the counter lifetime and loses
 * the target's s0 position carrier after the call. A split right-edge brightness
 * expression produces retail's v1/v0 order exactly, but jump2 cross-jumps the
 * now-identical multiply tails (as `rtx_renumbered_equal_p` permits after reload)
 * and shortens the function to 1436 bytes. A whole padded working struct, moving
 * the first read, moving xbase across the call, narrow/volatile locals, and
 * direct human constant spellings were all measured neutral or worse. The one
 * coherent improvement retained is a named right-edge brightness intermediate;
 * it keeps the exact CFG and length and improves 77 -> 76 bytes. */
