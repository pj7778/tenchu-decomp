 * over). A repeated name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.

/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 47 of 532 bytes differ (same instruction COUNT —
 * length matches exactly; every differing instruction is a genuine
 * instruction the draft already has elsewhere, only its SCHEDULED position
 * differs — no wrong value, no missing/extra logic).
 *
 * DrawBleed (0x8003437c, EFFECT.C:910) — the blood-drip effect's per-frame
 * draw: while `mode==0` and `time!=0`, advances the drip position by its
 * velocity (`pos += vec`) and drifts `vec.vy` by +1 (gravity-ish), or kills
 * the slot (`ef->proc = 0`) once `time` runs out; every frame regardless
 * decrements `time`, then projects `pos` (camera-relative, via the
 * FUN_80039544-style Scratchpad SetTransMatrix/SetRotMatrix/RotTransPers
 * idiom) and, if visible (`otz > 0x24`), fills the shared `plyBleed` POLY_F4
 * quad (a diagonal streak from `(x,y)` to `(x+sz,y+sz)`, `sz` a distance-
 * scaled length) and GsSortPoly's it into the OT with the same
 * `[0, 0x4e1]` OTZ-derived priority clamp as FUN_8003a2a8/FUN_8003a148.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `param = &ef->param.bleed;` (BleedType* at ef+4, matching PSX.SYM's
 *    own `reg $s1 struct BleedType * param`) — `pos` (VECTOR, s32 fields)
 *    and `vec` (SVECTOR, s16 fields) are BleedType's own proven layout
 *    (effect.h), no truncated per-TU redeclaration needed.
 *  - `param->time = param->time - 1;` is a REAL `addiu -1` (not the
 *    `+0xff` Ghidra's decompile TEXT shows) — the countdown-decrement
 *    idiom is per-function, decode the raw immediate (0xFFFF = -1), don't
 *    trust Ghidra's rendered constant.
 *  - The velocity integration needs FOUR independent statements, not a
 *    struct copy: `pos.vx+=vec.vx; pos.vy+=vec.vy; pos.vz+=vec.vz;
 *    vec.vy=vec.vy+1;` — `vec.vy` is read TWICE by the target, once
 *    SIGNED (`lh`, widening into the `pos.vy` s32 accumulator) and once
 *    UNSIGNED (`lhu`, the narrowing self-store `vec.vy=vec.vy+1`) — two
 *    un-CSE'd loads of one field, same family as DeleteConflict's
 *    ConflictObjects (a narrowing use of a signed field always loads
 *    `lhu`, a widening use loads `lh`; don't collapse to one shared read).
 *  - The camera-relative Scratchpad projection is FUN_80039544's own
 *    idiom verbatim (zero the 3-word rotation, store `pos - (short)View`
 *    per axis, `SetTransMatrix`/`SetRotMatrix`/`RotTransPers`).
 *  - `scr.vz` gets RotTransPers's return value truncated in by the caller
 *    (`scr.vz = (s16)RotTransPers(...)`), matching FUN_8003a148's `scr`
 *    convention exactly (x/y filled via the `sxy` out-param, z assigned
 *    separately from the call result).
 *  - `t = (s32)((u32)(u16)scr.vz << 16);` must be its own NAMED variable,
 *    reused for BOTH `otz = t >> 16` (the `>0x24` test + the `900/otz`
 *    divisor) AND the tail's OTZ clamp (`t >> 18`, i.e. `>> 0x12`) — the
 *    target computes the `(u16)x<<16` pattern only ONCE (one `lhu`) and
 *    keeps it alive in a register across the whole draw body (div, all the
 *    POLY_F4 field stores) to the clamp at the very end. Unlike
 *    FUN_8003a2a8/FUN_8003a148 (which each re-read `scr.vz` fresh for
 *    their own clamp — verified by their own asm), DrawBleed's target has
 *    NO second load at all: an independent re-read of `scr.vz` here costs
 *    an extra `lhu` (4 bytes) the target doesn't spend. Same shift-reuse
 *    idiom, opposite lever from the sibling functions — read the actual
 *    asm, don't assume the family's usual re-read.
 *  - POLY_F4 field STORE ORDER is the raw `.s`'s physical order, not
 *    Ghidra's rendered statement order: `x0,y0,y1,x2` first, THEN `sz`
 *    computed, THEN `x1,y2,x3,y3` (x3/y3 immediately follow x1/y2 — NOT
 *    deferred to just before GsSortPoly the way Ghidra's decompile
 *    renders them; m2c's raw-offset dump agrees with the asm), THEN
 *    `r0,g0,b0`. `x3`/`y3` reuse the SAME `scr.vx+sz`/`scr.vy+sz`
 *    expression as `x1`/`y2` (repeat the expression; the target's `sh`
 *    for x3/y3 reuses the still-live registers, not a fresh reload of
 *    `plyBleed.x1`/`.y2`).
 *  - The `[0, 0x4e1]` clamp is FUN_8003a2a8's exact `goto zero;` shape
 *    (the trivial `pri=0` body must be the branch TARGET, not the
 *    fall-through — see that file's header for the reorg mechanics).
 *  - This TU divides by a runtime value (`900 / otz`): needs
 *    `--expand-div` (Build.hs maspsxGpExterns' `extra` list + permute.py's
 *    MASPSX_EXTRA), same as DrawSprite/FUN_8003a2a8/FUN_8003a148.
 *
 * RESIDUAL (47 bytes, same class as DrawHinoko's own parked residual): the
 * target's SCHEDULER hoists `ViewInfo`'s `%hi` materialization (`lui
 * v1,%hi(ViewInfo)`) all the way into the FIRST branch's (`mode==0` test)
 * delay slot, and `pos.vy`/`pos.vz`'s FULL-WORD loads right after `time`'s
 * own reload — both well before their own statement's source position —
 * while this draft's schedule keeps them near their point of use. Confirmed
 * NOT a source-order issue: moving the `dy=pos.vy;dz=pos.vz;` statements
 * earlier in the C (before `time -= 1`) produced BYTE-IDENTICAL output,
 * proving cc1's list scheduler, not source position, decides how far to
 * hoist an independent load — same mechanism DrawHinoko.c's own residual
 * documents (a read hoisted far from its write, right instruction SET,
 * wrong SLOT). Also confirmed the LOAD WIDTH lever separately: `pos.vx/vy/vz`
 * (VECTOR, `long` fields) must be captured into plain `s32` temps (`dx`,
 * `dy`, `dz`) BEFORE the narrowing scratchpad store, or cc1's "narrowing
 * store" optimization narrows the LOAD itself to `lhu` (a valid modular-
 * arithmetic transform for the truncated subtraction, but 4 bytes short of
 * the target's `lw`) — the temps fixed the WIDTH; only the hoist DISTANCE
 * remains open. Tried and rejected: an explicit `TViewInfo *vp = &ViewInfo;`
 * declared at the very top (to bias the scheduler toward an early `lui`) —
 * this over-hoisted `%hi(ViewInfo)` even further (before the prologue's own
 * `sw ra`!) and regressed to 128 differing bytes; reverted. `tools/autorules.py`
 * found one real win (`pri: s32->s16`, 1004->48 differing bytes) already
 * applied; no further mechanical win. One bounded `tools/permute.py` run
 * (~300 s, `-j4 --stop-on-zero`) plateaued around score 175-760 with a
 * consistently high (100+) "errors" count that never reached 0 — consistent
 * with the cookbook's characterization: this divergence is chosen by a
 * later RTL pass (scheduling) the permuter's C-AST mutations cannot reach.
