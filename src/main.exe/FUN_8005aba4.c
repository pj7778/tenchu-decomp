/*
 * FUN_8005aba4 (0x8005aba4) — advance the memory-card state/message machine.
 *
 * `case 4` (ChkCard() dispatch) has FIVE origins that all need the same
 * "is next_state == 0x28" shift+test. A prior draft wrote that test out
 * TWICE — once after each of the two inner default: arms — reasoning that
 * cc1 would fold `next_state = 0x28; shifted = (u32)(u16)next_state << 16;`
 * into a `lui` there (which it does) and leave the genuine dynamic
 * sll/sra only at the shared `card_state_shift:` label used by the other
 * three origins. That measured 13 bytes off across 6 instructions.
 *
 * The target's raw asm shows this fold is wrong: ALL FIVE origins reach
 * the SAME single `sll $v0,$s0,16 / sra $v0,$v0,16` — there is only ONE
 * `next_state != 0x28` test in the source, reached by `goto` from every
 * arm (including both defaults). The apparent "extra" sll/sra copies at
 * two addresses are a pure reorg (delay-slot-fill) artifact: the two
 * default arms' `addiu $s0,0x28` gets sunk into the PRECEDING beq's delay
 * slot (the fallthrough continuation is safe to run on the taken path too,
 * since the taken target immediately overwrites $s0), which leaves each
 * default's own trailing unconditional `j card_state_shift` with an empty
 * delay slot — reorg fills THAT with a duplicated copy of the jump
 * target's first instruction (the shared `sll`) and retargets the jump
 * to land just past it. Two lexical copies of the C statement produce
 * three lexical instances feeding the fold; one shared C statement,
 * reached by goto from all five arms, produces the target's exact
 * three-physical-copy, zero-fold shape for free — plainer C, exact match.
 * Lesson: when a "duplicated" instruction sequence appears at multiple
 * addresses but every appearance is the delay slot of an unconditional
 * jump to a common label, suspect reorg's delay-slot fill-from-target
 * before suspecting the source has two copies of the statement.
