/*
 * ThinkBasicHuman1 (0x8002f820, 0xa4 bytes) — think-handler (same "think" TU
 * as Think1sleep.c/Think1trace.c/ThinkBasicHuman2.c): reads port-0 held
 * buttons through FUN_8001b2f4 (a pad-processing helper, not yet named/
 * matched), clears them all if bit 0x100 is held while SystemFlag's bit 0 is
 * set (a cheat/debug toggle), masks to the low 12 bits while the area
 * attribute bit 0x200 is set and the character is jumping/landing
 * (character_status 9 or 7), then remaps bit 3 to bit 5 (0x8 -> 0x20).
 *
 * `Me_THINK_C->attrib` (game_types.h, new field @0x28 — see its header
 * comment there) is proven by the raw `lhu` here; `(s16)Me_THINK_C->
 * character_status` follows Think1ninja.c's established per-TU load-width
 * cast (proven u16 field; this TU's asm reads it `lh`).
 *
 * FUN_8001b2f4's return must be a WIDE type (s32, not s16) in this caller: no
 * sll/sra re-extension follows its call (unlike GetPad's result, which DOES
 * get the short-result pair right before being passed in as the argument) —
 * the "Ghidra's short-typed call-result variable can be int in source" rule.
