/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — 15 of 112 bytes differ (whole-image: 15, function
 * is the right length, 28 insns both sides) — a pure register-color
 * residual (uniform +1 shift: a1<-a2, a2<-a3, a3<-t0). autorules: no
 * genuinely-correct improving edit (its own scoring disagreed with
 * tools/matchdiff.py's raw byte diff twice on this function — see notes).
 * Three bounded tools/permute.py runs (score 510->145->85, each seeded
 * from the prior best, ~30k iterations total) found real improvements
 * that were hand-applied (see below) but none reached 0.
 *
 * FUN_8001b2f4 (0x8001b2f4) — pad button REMAPPER: called by
 * ThinkBasicHuman1 as `pad = FUN_8001b2f4(GetPad(0));` (see
 * ThinkBasicHuman1.c's matching notes — established prototype
 * `extern s32 FUN_8001b2f4(s16 pad);`, wide s32 return). Not yet named or
 * placed in reference/psxsym-candidates.tsv / psxsym-unplaced.tsv (no
 * PSX.SYM block — checked both by address and by name).
 *
 * D_80011210 is a 32-byte table: 4 "control-scheme" rows of 8 bytes, each
 * row a permutation of the 8 single-bit pad masks (0x01/0x02/.../0x80).
 * D_800976F6 (a %gp_rel short, control-scheme index 0-3) selects the row
 * (`row = D_800976F6 << 3`). For each of the 8 canonical button positions
 * i, the function tests the CALLER's raw pad bits against row 0's mask
 * `D_80011210[i]` and, if set, OR's the SELECTED scheme's mask
 * `D_80011210[row+i]` into the result (remapping physical button i to
 * logical position row+i); if clear, it AND-clears that same logical bit.
 * This is a classic PS1 "control type A/B/C/D" pad remapper. Untried
 * candidate names from the unplaced/candidates lists (SetPadState,
 * SetPad) don't fit this address or behavior.
 *
 * Matching notes:
 *  - `pad` (the parameter, s16) is a byte/bit TEST source only; `acc` (the
 *    OR/AND accumulator, u16, seeded from `pad` so the untouched high
 *    bits/unlisted buttons pass through unchanged) is the separate
 *    register that survives to the return. Ghidra's `ushort uVar2` is the
 *    accumulator's real type — the final `(int)(short)` cast at the
 *    return re-establishes sign, matching the caller's s32-return
 *    prototype.
 *  - The row-clearing branch's mask is read raw as `u8` (`D_80011210[row]`)
 *    then bitwise-NOT'd in the FULL (int-promoted, zero-extended) width —
 *    this is what compiles to the `nor $zero,v0` / `and` pair, not an
 *    `andi` (0x80011210's bytes never need masking down further).
 *  - `i` (0..7, the row-0 test index) and `row` (the selected row's index,
 *    incrementing in lockstep) are two SEPARATE loop-carried values
 *    (register $a2 / $v1) — both start together (`i=0`, `row=scheme<<3`)
 *    and both `+= 1` every iteration, but they are NOT the same variable
 *    (only `row`'s start is offset by the scheme selection).
 *  - Loop is a genuine `do { ... } while (i < 8);` — `i` starts at 0 and
 *    the bound is a compile-time constant 8, so jump.c's
 *    duplicate_loop_exit_test folds away any entry guard regardless of
 *    for/while/do-while spelling; do-while matches Ghidra's own shape.
 *  - The declaration-order/dead-initial-`rp` and the `test` split (holding
 *    the bit-test result in its OWN pseudo instead of inline in the `if`)
 *    both came from decomp-permuter, verified afterward with
 *    `tools/matchdiff.py` (28->15 bytes) — a THIRD permuter round found a
 *    45-scoring "improvement" (making the loop bound test `test < 8`
 *    instead of `i < 8`) that is semantically WRONG (`test` holds
 *    `pad & D_80011210[i]`, not the counter) and was rejected despite the
 *    better score — permuter/autorules scores are a proxy, not proof;
 *    only `tools/matchdiff.py`'s raw byte diff and a manual read of what
 *    changed are.
 *
 * RTL escalation (this session): `tools/rtldump.py --draft --pass loop`
 * PROVES `rp` must stay a NAMED, SINGLE-textual-reference pointer (assigned
 * once per iteration, read via `*rp` in both arms) rather than writing
 * `D_80011210[row]` inline in EACH arm. With two inline occurrences,
 * `.loop`'s combine_givs sums their benefits (`giv at 58 combined with giv
 * at 59`, `giv at 45 combined with 59`, `giv at 44 combined with 59` — 4
 * records from the 2 arms) and crosses the strength-reduction threshold,
 * turning `row` itself into an incrementing BYTE POINTER (biv 83
 * eliminated) — a different, 1-instruction-LONGER shape (116 vs 112 bytes)
 * that the target does not have. With exactly one textual `D_80011210[i]`
 * reference (`i`'s own address calc), the same dump shows `giv of insn 34
 * not worth while, 0 vs 22` — below threshold, `i` stays a plain SI
 * counter, matching target. So the single-reference `rp` form is not
 * cosmetic — it is the only spelling that keeps `row` a counter instead of
 * a giv.
 *
 * The remaining 15-byte residual (`.greg`, same draft) is a pure
 * global-alloc priority tie, NOT a structural difference — our compile
 * ALREADY schedules `rp`'s address calc into the `beqz`'s delay slot
 * exactly like the target (`addu $5,$3,$8` sits in the branch's delay
 * slot), it just lands in a different hard reg. `rp`'s pseudo has by far
 * the highest priority of the 6 global allocnos (refs=6 over a 4-insn
 * life: `floor_log2(6)*6/4 = 3.0`, vs `acc` 1.25, `i` 1.23, `row` 0.88,
 * `D_80011210`'s base-pointer 0.29) so global-alloc places it FIRST; it
 * hard-conflicts with `v0` (the `test`/AND-result pseudo is still live at
 * that program point in the pre-scheduling RTL global-alloc sees) and
 * `a0` (the sign-extended `pad`, live the whole function), and `row`
 * already carries an explicit `preferences: 3` ($v1) — per the cookbook's
 * "find_reg makes an earlier higher-priority allocno AVOID a reg a later
 * allocno prefers" rule, `rp` (processed first) avoids $v1 too, so it
 * falls through to the next free candidate, $a1 — one slot ahead of
 * where `acc`/`i`/the base pointer land relative to target ($a1/$a2/$a3
 * vs target's $a2/$a3/t0 — the header's "uniform +1 shift"). Tried and
 * reverted: swapping the `test`/`rp` assignment order inside the loop
 * (28 bytes, worse); a ternary `acc = test ? acc|D_80011210[row] :
 * acc&~D_80011210[row]` (triggers the same unwanted strength-reduction as
 * the two-inline-reference form, wrong length). A 4th bounded permuter
 * round (`--stop-on-zero -j4`, ~150s, ~1400+ iterations) plateaued at
 * score 45 via a semantically-broken candidate (shadows the `pad`
 * parameter with an uninitialized same-named local) — not a real fix,
 * matches the already-documented "score is a proxy" warning above; no
 * valid zero-score candidate found. Root cause is a genuine global-alloc
 * priority tie on `rp`'s allocno, not a reachable C-level lever.
