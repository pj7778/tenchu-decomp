 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - The caller's own extern (BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen.c)
 *    declares all 4 params `int`; Ghidra guesses `short x,y,size,rotdif`
 *    for the defining TU here — but Ghidra's own rendering of the rotate
 *    update (`CONCAT22(in_register_0000001e,rotdif)`) is the decompiler's
 *    tell that its "short rotdif" guess is wrong: CONCAT22 reassembles a
 *    register Ghidra typed too narrow back to its real 32-bit width. The
 *    raw asm confirms: `rotdif` (a3) feeds `addu` against the full 32-bit
 *    `.rotate` with NO sign-extend, so it's `s32`; m2c's per-register
 *    typing (`s16,s16,s16,s32`) already had this right — x/y/size stay
 *    `short` (only ever truncating-stored via `sh`, which needs no widen
 *    either way, unlike a short forwarded as a callee's register argument
 *    — see SetLightning.c).
 *  - OTablePt is ABSOLUTE in this TU (lui+lw), unlike DrawBG.c's %gp_rel —
 *    gp-vs-absolute for the same extern is a per-TU property (gpsyms.py
 *    found no %gp_rel operand here, so this file is NOT added to the gp
 *    lists).
