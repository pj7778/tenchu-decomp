/*
 * dispose_weapon_data_of_char_ (0x800270c8) — NOT a null-checked disposer
 * despite the name: the raw asm has no branch at all. Same original TU as
 * NowReturnNormal.c (adjacent addresses, 0x80027004/0x800270c8; shares its
 * `extern Humanoid *Me_MOTION_C` gp global) — latches the character and its
 * motion manager into the module-global "current" pointers, then forwards
 * to AttackCancelControl. `a`'s int->short truncation (sll16/sra16 in the
 * jal's delay slot) comes from AttackCancelControl's prototype narrowing an
 * `int` argument to a `short` parameter, not from re-widening a short local.
 * The h->motion load schedules ahead of the Me_MOTION_C store (independent,
 * no alias) even though Ghidra/source order writes Me_MOTION_C first —
 * trust the source order, not the asm position (cookbook: independent loads
 * hoist above unrelated stores).
 *
 * Both `Me_MOTION_C` and `dtM` are gp-relative in the target (`sw a0,N(gp)`)
 * so this file needs a maspsx --gp-extern entry (see shake/src/Build.hs
 * maspsxGpExterns / tools/permute.py GP_EXTERNS) or cc1 materializes a full
 * lui/addiu address instead, which is both longer and the wrong instructions.
