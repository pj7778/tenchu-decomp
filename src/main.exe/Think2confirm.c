 * Think2confirm (0x8002fa24, 0x30 bytes) — think-handler, same "think" TU as
 * Think1sleep.c/ThinkBasicHuman2.c (s16 return convention; shared
 * turn_towards_player_ extern from main.exe.h).
 *
 * The mask literal's SPELLING picks the instruction shape (fits-andi lever):
 * Think1sleep.c's `uVar1 & 0xA000` (a positive literal, fits the unsigned
 * 16-bit andi immediate) compiles to `andi $a1,$v0,0xa000`. Here the asm
 * instead materializes a full register constant (`addiu $v1,$zero,-0x6000`)
 * and does a register-register `and` — the target's literal does NOT fit
 * andi's unsigned-16-bit test, i.e. it's negative: `~0x5FFF` (bitwise NOT of
 * a positive 16-bit constant) is exactly -0x6000/0xFFFFA000, confirmed
 * against the encoded `addiu` immediate.
