/*
 * ReqItemKaengeki (0x80043c0c) — spawn a "kaengeki" item. Twin of
 * ReqItemDrop/ReqItemJirai/ReqItemSmoke/ReqItemFire/ReqItemDokudango (same
 * item TU, same pool round-robin on COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_ and the same
 * dispose-on-exhaustion block); like ReqItemJirai/ReqItemSmoke/ReqItemFire/
 * ReqItemDokudango there is no GetAreaMapLevel floor check. It gets
 * ProcItemKaengeki as its processor.
 *
 * Unlike those siblings' narrowed param_korogari throw-velocity view, this
 * one packs p->start AND p->end as SIX FULL 32-bit words (not s16s) into
 * it->param at offsets 0/4/8/0x10/0x14/0x18 — tools/access.py confirms all
 * six are `sw`, not `sh`, so it's a distinct/wider union view than
 * param_korogari; per the cookbook's divergent-width-union rule these are
 * reached via raw offset casts off the SAME proven `pp` pointer. Offset 0
 * is the exception: the asm addresses it as 0x20($s0) (a fresh it->param
 * cast), the same lever the other twins use for `hint = 0` at that same
 * offset, rather than through pp.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `pp = (param_korogari *)it->param;` sits BEFORE the null check, same
 *    lever as the other twins (addiu fills the beqz delay slot) — even
 *    though every param field here is reached through a raw offset cast
 *    instead of pp's own named members.
 *  - `st = &p->start;` materialized between the t[0] and t[1] stores, same
 *    as the other twins; dead afterward (p->start.vy/vz are re-read
 *    directly off p, not through st, in the param tail below).
 *  - us/ty are real temps, same shape as the other twins.
 *  - The six start/end fields are INLINE (no x/y/z temps): each compiles to
 *    one lw immediately followed by its sw with no batching, unlike the
 *    s16-narrowing twins which batch three loads before three stores.
