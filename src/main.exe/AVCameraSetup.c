/*
 * AVCameraSetup (0x80051074, 0x1b4 bytes) — sets ViewInfo's target position
 * (vpx/vpy/vpz) from a "camera event" record (CHOSEN_EVENT_LIST_THING_
 * LOCATION, already-named — a cursor into PERSISTENT_EVENT_LIST_THING) whose
 * `.mode`@0x2 dispatches: 4 = fixed point (x/y/z@0x4/0x6/0x8, scaled *100);
 * 0..3 = orbit D_80097CC4 (the active camera-owner Humanoid, set by
 * CVAsequence to StagePlayer) at a computed angle via GetMoveSpeed, offset
 * by D_80097CC4->locate; 5 = re-target a NEW humanoid (GetHumanoid(event's
 * `.param`@0xA), bailing with no GsSetRefView2 call if not found) and adopt
 * it as the new D_80097CC4. item.h's Humanoid (rotate@0x3C, locate@0x38,
 * height@0xE) accounts for every field read here.
 *
 * Matching notes (docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `event->mode` is read ONCE and reused across the whole dispatch (no
 *    reload) — a plain repeated `event->mode` dereference CSEs to one load
 *    within the function's single extended basic block, no named local
 *    needed (matches PSX.SYM listing no such local).
 *  - **Dispatch body order differs from test order**: the tests fire
 *    4, <5, ==5 but the target lays the bodies out <5(orbit), 4, 5 in
 *    memory (the orbit body ends with an explicit jump to the shared
 *    tail; the `==4` body also jumps; the `==5` body is textually LAST
 *    and falls through with no trailing jump). A plain if/else-if always
 *    inlines each body right after its own test, giving the wrong layout
 *    — this needs the cookbook's `if (cond) goto L;` ladder, with the
 *    goto LABELS placed in the target's memory order while the tests stay
 *    in their own (different) order.
 *  - The orbit branch's angle (`(u16)rotate->vy + mode*0x400`, explicitly
 *    unsigned per Ghidra's own `(ushort)` cast — SVECTOR.vy is otherwise
 *    signed) is computed ONCE into a shared `s32` temp, stored to
 *    `vect.pad` (a plain field write, matching Ghidra's own
 *    `local_10.pad = (short)iVar2` rendering) THEN passed (truncated) as
 *    GetMoveSpeed's `ry` — writing it twice inline would double the
 *    load/shift instead of reusing one register.
 *  - **The `ordr` default-3000-else-override must be the inline ternary
 *    call ARGUMENT itself**, not a preceding `ordr = cond ? a : b;`
 *    statement (even though the value is used nowhere else): assigning it
 *    to a named local first — whether via if/else, a temp read of
 *    `event->param`, or a ternary — makes cc1 read `event->param` a
 *    SECOND time (an extra unsigned `lhu`, since a bare argument pass
 *    doesn't need sign extension) instead of reusing the first (signed)
 *    read from the zero-test, costing 3 extra instructions and shuffling
 *    the whole function's register colors. Folding the ternary directly
 *    into the call's 3rd argument position fixed it in one edit.
