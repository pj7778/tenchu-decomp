 *
 * void SetCameraMode(enum TCameraMode mode);
 *     CAMERA.C:85, 9 src lines, frame 24 bytes, saved-reg mask 0x80010000 (DEMO build -- see below)
 *
 * Original parameters and locals (the demo COUNT and TYPES are high-value
 * codegen evidence, not a retail spec: an earlier-build helper/API change
 * can replace either). Retail access widths and callee ABI win. A repeated
 * name is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate.
 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound
 * and a hint at how many values stay live, never as a spec. The asm wins.
 * Locals:
 *     param $a0       enum TCameraMode mode
 *
 * Globals it touches, as the original declared them:
 *     extern struct TCameraStatus CamState;
 *     extern struct GsRVIEW2 ViewInfo;

/*
 * SetCameraMode (0x800316b8) — camera mode dispatcher (CAMERA.C).
 * 16-entry jump-table switch; case bodies in source order 4, 15, {1,3}, 0,
 * default (memory order = source order), with case 4's critical-hit success
 * body as a labeled block between case 0 and default (goto target, reached
 * from inside the loop; it reuses the loop's cs pseudo in $s4).
 *
 * NOTE the retail TCameraStatus layout differs from the demo PSX.SYM one:
 * DirectionRX/RY sit at 0x18/0x1A (demo: 0x1C/0x1E) and 0x1C/0x1D are two
 * BYTE fields (OldMode as a byte reused as the critical-camera index + a
 * critical-hit flag), proven by the raw sh 0x18/sh 0x1A/sb 0x1C/sb 0x1D in
 * this function's own asm.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - Case 4's search loop is a hand-rolled goto loop (loop:/goto loop): no
 *    loop notes, so nothing hoists/forces the &va..&vd call args — each
 *    RotTrans/FUN_80039ddc frame-address arg re-materializes `addiu aN,sp,N`
 *    at its use. cs/tbl/fp are REAL locals assigned before the loop (that is
 *    what the "hoisted" $s4/$s7/$s3 are); cs's init lands as `addu s4,a1`
 *    because cse folds it onto the preceding OldMode-store's address pseudo.
 *  - The scratchpad STORES go through small extern symbols
 *    (scratch_rot_1f800040 / scratch_trans_1f800094) — a small-extern store
 *    is the one-op $at macro AND is MEM_IN_STRUCT_P, which keeps sched.c's
 *    true_dependence (its MEM_IN_STRUCT heuristic) from batching the
 *    rot->vx/vy/vz and pos->vx/vy/vz loads past the preceding stores: the pairs
 *    stay serialized through one register like the target. Flat
 *    *(s16 *)0x1F8000xx casts are NOT in-struct -> the loads batch (wrong);
 *    struct-pointer casts lose the constant-address macro form (wrong).
 *    The GTE-call ARGS stay literal casts (raw lui/ori), as the bytes show.
 *  - The two do{}while(0) wrappers are load-bearing:
 *    (a) around the scratch-rot stores + RotMatrixYXZ: flow.c counts refs at
 *        +1 loop depth, boosting rot's allocno above p so the allocation
 *        order is rot->$s0, p->$s1 (they come out swapped otherwise);
 *    (b) around the four RotTrans calls: the loop notes are sched1 barriers,
 *        pinning `i++` at the loop bottom (it otherwise floats into a
 *        load-delay slot mid-body), so reorg fills the bnez delay slot with
 *        it and the backjump's slot with the loop-top slti.
 *  - `RotTrans(p+2, pv = &vc, fp); RotTrans(p+3, pv = &vd, fp); pv = 0;`:
 *    each pv reassignment EVICTS pv's register from cse's value class for
 *    the previous &vN, and the dead `pv = 0;` (deleted by flow, zero bytes)
 *    evicts it from &vd's class — so the FUN_80039ddc args find no register
 *    equivalent and re-materialize fresh addius like the target. Without
 *    this, cse2 (which unlike cse1 does not stop at LOOP_END notes) folds
 *    the ddc args onto the RotTrans arg pseudos, which then need two extra
 *    callee-saved registers ($s0/$s2 + moves).
 *  - `p = (SVECTOR *)(cs->OldMode * 0x20 + (s32)tbl);` — INTEGER addition in
 *    source order emits `addu p,index,base` (any pointer-arithmetic spelling
 *    normalizes to base+index at the tree level and emits the operands
 *    swapped). Inline (no offset temp) so the lbu/sll/addu chain fuses into
 *    p's register; the entry rand() result is a SEPARATE variable n
 *    (caller-saved $v1) — Ghidra's iVar4 double-role is an SSA artifact.
 *  - FUN_8002fd9c takes the Humanoid* (its own asm derefs $a0 at
 *    0x30/0x38/0x3C); passing cs->Owner ties the Owner temp to $a0.
 *  - hitf (a named flag for the ddc result compare) keeps the scc form
 *    slti/xori/bnez; an inline `if (... > 0x7ff)` compiles slti/beqz (short).
