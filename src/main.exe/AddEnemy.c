 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — complete pure-C reconstruction at the exact target
 * extent (1152 bytes / 288 instructions) and exact 0x810 frame.  The guarded
 * draft has 27 differing bytes
 * (183 -> 161 -> 125 -> 81 -> 72 -> 52 -> 42 -> 35 -> 29 -> 27).
 *
 * ROUND 14 (+-0): ROUND 13's FIVE-STEP PROOF OF (E) IS WITHDRAWN — IT READS
 * THE WRONG PASS AND THE WRONG TIEBREAK.  (E) is still unmatched, but it is
 * NOT "proved unreachable"; the mechanism that decides it has been misnamed
 * for two rounds.  Byte accounting, re-measured this round (matchdiff -n after
 * a real rebuild, not inherited):
 *     (A) 14B  0x5d4-0x5e0  loop-1 preheader ORDER   — same ROTATION as (E)
 *     (C)  1B  0x81c        `move a1,s0` vs `,s1`    — untested since (E) moved
 *     (E) 12B  0x8dc-0x8e4  `move a0,s7` position    — OPEN, mechanism renamed
 *
 * (0) **(E) IS DECIDED IN sched2, NOT sched1, AND BY potential_hazard, NOT
 *     LUID.**  Round 13's proof is built entirely on the `.sched` (sched1)
 *     priority print.  Two of its steps are measurably false; reproduce with
 *     `tools/sched-deps.py AddEnemy --pass sched --block 32 --asm` (the tool
 *     self-validates against cc1's own post-pass chain and refuses to print on
 *     divergence):
 *
 *      - **WRONG PASS.**  sched1 emits [1460][1461][1463][1465][1488] — 1488
 *        is LAST, at index 4.  The `--asm` bridge (cc1's own -dp annotation)
 *        puts the final asm at 1460->192, 1461->193, **1488->194**, 1463->195:
 *        sched2 MOVED 1488 from index 4 to index 2, and sched2's order IS the
 *        emitted order.  Every priority number in round 13's proof is a sched1
 *        number describing an ordering sched2 overwrote.
 *      - **WRONG TIEBREAK.**  Step 2 says "it takes ready[0], and
 *        rank_for_schedule is priority DESC -> class DESC -> LUID DESC".
 *        rank_for_schedule only sets the SORT.  schedule_select (sched.c:2647)
 *        then walks the ready list in EQUAL-PRIORITY GROUPS and, when more
 *        than one member survives the actual_hazard queueing, picks the
 *        largest **potential_hazard** (2689-2703) — not ready[0], not LUID.
 *        LUID decides only among EQUAL hazards (`>` is strict, so the
 *        earliest-sorted wins).  cc1 prints this and sched-deps renders it:
 *            3  195  53  1463  ... <- HAZARD SWAP: beat insn 1488
 *        In sched2, insn 1463 (a LOAD, non-zero potential_hazard) BEAT 1488
 *        (`move a0,s7`, an ALU op, hazard 0).  That swap is what put 1488 at
 *        194.  The priority-1 tie is real; "the tie falls through to LUID" is
 *        not.
 *
 *     So the live question for (E) is no longer "break a priority-1 LUID tie".
 *     It is: **1488 is an ALU move with potential_hazard 0, tied at priority 1
 *     with 1460/1461 (`high`/`lo_sum`, also hazard 0); among equal hazards the
 *     highest LUID is picked first and lands last, and 1488's LUID is highest
 *     because sched1 emitted it last.**  The reachable lever is therefore
 *     sched1's OUTPUT ORDER (which is what assigns sched2's LUIDs), or giving
 *     the group unequal hazards.  Neither has been tried.
 *
 * (0a) **THE BIRTHING/adjust_priority ESCAPE: REFUTED FOR (E), TWICE OVER.**
 *     The round-14 brief correctly established the machinery — verified here
 *     with `tools/ccsrc.py adjust_priority` / `birthing_insn_p`: the n_deaths
 *     switch IS dead ("REG_DEAD notes are removed before we ever get here"),
 *     the ADJUST_PRIORITY macro's absence on MIPS IS irrelevant (the bump
 *     lives in the function), and sched.c:3923 DOES park LAUNCH_PRIORITY
 *     (0x7f000001) on the scheduling insn immediately before schedule_insn, so
 *     2605's `max_priority = MAX(INSN_PRIORITY(ready[0]), INSN_PRIORITY(insn))`
 *     is always >= 0x7f000001 and a birthing producer really is bumped clean
 *     off the floor.  It still cannot reach (E):
 *      1. **The bump is gated off in sched2.**  birthing_insn_p returns 0 when
 *         `reload_completed == 1` (sched.c:2504) and adjust_priority's whole
 *         body is under `if (reload_completed == 0)` (2540).  (E) is decided in
 *         sched2, where reload_completed == 1.  The bump CANNOT FIRE there.
 *      2. **1488 could never be birthing anyway.**  It is
 *         `(set (reg:SI 4 a0) (reg/v:SI 81))` — the dest is HARD REG a0.
 *         birthing_insn_p returns `REG_N_SETS(REGNO(dest)) == 1`, and every one
 *         of AddEnemy's many call sites sets a0, so REG_N_SETS(4) >> 1.  No
 *         source change reaches this.
 *     Note (2) generalises and is worth keeping: **a hard-register argument
 *     move can never be BIRTHING in a multi-call function.**  This is NOT the
 *     refuted "argmoves are a priority floor" rule (argmoves routinely sit
 *     above priority 1 via their producers, and 1488's own group proves the
 *     hazard tiebreak outranks LUID) — it closes only the birthing escape.
 *
 * (0b) **THE STALE PERMUTER NEGATIVE IS REFUTED — AND THE WIN WAS REJECTED.**
 *     Round 13's "(E) IS PERMUTER-IMMUNE AND FENCE-IMMUNE" did not survive one
 *     fresh bounded run (`timeout 240 ... --stop-on-zero -j4`, 15899 iters):
 *     the full-link rescore found **26** vs base's 27.  Its minimal semantic
 *     delta was three edits the header already called impossible individually
 *     (L299 "relocate `weapon_base = WeaponModel` into the loop body CANNOT
 *     WORK", L489 `think |=` measured 42-93, plus dropping `stage_kinds`).
 *     Measured this round, separated:
 *         stage_kinds-elim + `think |=`, weapon_base pre-loop : 27  (neutral)
 *         + `weapon_base = WeaponModel` moved INTO the loop   : 26
 *     So the whole gain is the weapon_base move — and it is a LOCAL OPTIMUM
 *     AWAY FROM RETAIL.  It buys 2 bytes on the (A) rotation (`li s6,-1` /
 *     `addiu s8,a0,-30068` start matching) and gives 1 back as a NEW
 *     divergence retail does not have: 0x8005b790 `bne v0,s6,0x8005b5e8`
 *     (target) becomes `bne v0,s6,0x8005b5e0` (ours).  That displacement IS the
 *     loop head: retail materialises the WeaponModel address ONCE, above the
 *     loop; the 26-state re-executes the lui/addiu every iteration.  Retail's
 *     own branch target is the evidence that `weapon_base = WeaponModel`
 *     belongs PRE-LOOP, which is where it is.  Rejected; the tree keeps 27.
 *     (Do not re-derive this: the 26 is reproducible, it is just wrong.)
 *
 * (1) **(D) FELL TO AN ARRAY_REF CARRIER.**  Round 11 identified the cause
 *     (ARRAY_REF expands base-first via get_inner_reference; a pointer index
 *     builds INDIRECT_REF(PLUS_EXPR(ptr,idx*size)) and comes out index-first)
 *     but parked it as "not yet spendable", because `ItemName[count]` here
 *     rematerialises `addiu ...,sp,1424` (+1 insn) — cse2 resets its table at
 *     .L8005B880 — and asked for "a form that keeps the menu_base REG as the
 *     base while taking the ARRAY_REF path".  That form exists.  READ
 *     c-typeck.c:1406 (gcc-2.8.1 in the nix store), which gates ARRAY_REF on
 *         TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (array)) == ARRAY_TYPE
 *         && TREE_CODE (array) != INDIRECT_REF
 *     Two consequences, and the second is the win:
 *      - the OBVIOUS construct is DEAD ON ARRIVAL.  A pointer-to-array cast,
 *        `(*(debug_menu_choice (*)[70])menu_base)[count]`, makes `array` an
 *        INDIRECT_REF, fails the second test, and falls through to the SAME
 *        index-first pointer arithmetic.  Do not spend a build on it.
 *      - a COMPONENT_REF is NOT an INDIRECT_REF and can still have ARRAY_TYPE.
 *        `((AddEnemyMenuArray *)menu_base)->a[count]` therefore passes BOTH
 *        tests and builds a real ARRAY_REF, while its inner reference is still
 *        the bare `menu_base` REG — so expand_expr emits
 *        PLUS(menu_base_reg, offset) (base-first, retail's order) with NO
 *        frame-address rematerialisation.  mark_addressable is harmless here:
 *        on a COMPONENT_REF it walks to operand 0 (c-typeck.c:3365) and an
 *        INDIRECT_REF hits the permissive default.
 *
 * (2) **[RETRACTED BY ROUND 13 — READ (0) ABOVE FIRST.  THIS NOTE IS WRONG.
 *     Round 7 was NOT inverted; cc1's own trace prints priority = 1 for insn
 *     1460, tied with 1488.  "Heads a ~7-deep chain" is the ref_count column,
 *     and it belongs to insn 1465.  Kept only so the error is legible.]**
 *     ~~ROUND 7's MECHANISM FOR (E) IS INVERTED — the park survives, the
 *     reason does not.~~  Round 7 wrote "the CamState `high` (insn 1607)
 *     already has priority 1 — the floor".  MEASURED from our own .sched dump
 *     this round: the CamState high (now insn 1460) has LOG_LINKS (nil) but
 *     HEADS a ~7-deep chain 1460 -> 1461 -> 1463 -> 1465 -> {1468,1471,1474,
 *     1477} -> 1492 -> jal, i.e. the HIGHEST height in the block.  It is
 *         (insn 1488 ... (set (reg:SI 4 a0) (reg/v:SI 81)) ... (nil) (nil))
 *     — `move a0,s7` — that sits at the floor: LOG_LINKS (nil) and exactly one
 *     insn below it (the jal's USE).  sched emits height DESC: our own sched1
 *     output puts the chain first and pulls 1488 up only as far as the first
 *     load-use slot.  Retail emits the LOWEST-height insn BEFORE the highest —
 *     anti-priority — so (E) is not reachable by reordering the exit-block
 *     statements at all.  It needs `a0 = type` to CARRY REAL HEIGHT, which a
 *     call-arg reg move (expand_call emits it after every arg is evaluated,
 *     one USE at the jal) structurally cannot.  This is why the fence and the
 *     permuter both failed: they were aimed at a tie that does not exist.
 *     Whoever reopens (E) must attack the CHAIN's height or a0's, not order.
 *
 * ROUND 11 (-6): CLUSTER (B) CLOSED.  **AND THE ROUND-10 CHARTER FOR (A) WAS
 * A CATEGORY ERROR — (A) IS NOT A REGISTER TIE IN THIS DRAFT AT ALL.**
 *
 * (0) **RE-MEASURE, AGAIN.**  Round 10's headline lesson ("a measured fact
 *     survived five rounds and was false") recursed onto round 10 itself.  Its
 *     charter — "find ONE more loop-1 allocno with priority > 520 so both bases
 *     fall out of $s0-$s7 and priority-DESC hands WM $t0 / SA $t1" — describes
 *     **E3's** allocation, not this checkpoint's.  MEASURED (objdump, this file):
 *     our preheader already emits SA -> $t1, WM -> $t0, -1 -> $s6,
 *     HumanData -> $fp.  **Every register in (A) ALREADY equals retail's.**
 *     The 14 bytes are pure EMISSION ORDER:
 *         ours   [SA][WM][-1][HD]      target [SA][-1][HD][WM]
 *     Do not re-derive the allocno arithmetic; there is no tie to break.
 *
 * (1) **(A) IS A MOVABLE-DISCOVERY-ORDER PROBLEM — round 9 had it right.**
 *     Hoists are emitted with emit_insn_before(loop_start), i.e. AFTER every
 *     pre-loop statement.  Ours makes SA *and* WM pre-loop statements, so both
 *     precede the -1/HD hoists.  Retail's WM lands after them, so retail's WM
 *     IS a movable.  Verified against the pinned loop.c (:691-703): gate 1 is a
 *     three-case disjunction, and `weapon_base` fails all three —
 *     REG_USERVAR_P kills case (2); loop 1's `count >= 70` break puts a
 *     conditional jump at the body top so maybe_never == 1 kills case (3); and
 *     it is live across basic blocks, killing case (1)'s reg_in_basic_block_p.
 *     Only a compiler TEMP can be the movable — i.e. only E3.  (A) therefore
 *     still costs the E3 restructure; E3 remains 107 residual lines in 49
 *     blocks vs this checkpoint's 8 lines in 7.  Not a dial.
 *
 * (2) **(B) CLOSED (-6) — a returning guard's delay slot is won by SOURCE
 *     POSITION, not by a fence.**  Target fills `beq $v0,$s6,.L8005B76C`'s
 *     delay slot with `j = 0` and starts the if-body with the (s16)i extend;
 *     ours had them swapped.  `j = 0` sat INSIDE the `if`, where it competes
 *     with the HumanData[i].type chain for the block's first slot and loses on
 *     sched2 priority (height 1 vs 7 — sched.c rank_for_schedule is
 *     priority-dominant).  Hoisting `j = 0` ABOVE the `if` hands it to dbr's
 *     BACKWARD scan (fill_simple_delay_slots takes an insn from before the
 *     branch that the branch does not depend on), and the if-body then starts
 *     with the sll.  Zero weight change: same loop depth, no new fence, and j
 *     is dead on the else path so it is semantically free.
 *
 * (3) **(E) (12B) IS PERMUTER-IMMUNE AND FENCE-IMMUNE — do not spend a fence
 *     on it.**  `.L8005B8DC` wants [a0=type][lui CamState][addiu CamState][lw];
 *     we emit [lui][addiu][a0=type][lw].  Same regs, same fillers, one insn
 *     misplaced.  `a0 = type` is a call-argument reg move, which expand_call
 *     emits AFTER all argument evaluation — so it is LUID-LAST and lowest
 *     priority.  A fence cannot help: loop notes only PREVENT motion
 *     (sched_analyze_insn adds anti-deps both ways), they cannot pull a
 *     LUID-last insn earlier.  A bounded permuter run (420s, -j4) did not beat
 *     the base.  Retail must be reaching this via a priority/LUID difference
 *     not yet identified; do not re-run the permuter on it.
 *
 * (4) **(D) (2B) IS THE ARRAY_REF-vs-POINTER OPERAND-ORDER SPLIT — identified,
 *     not yet spendable.**  Target `addu $v0,$s0,$v0` (base+index); ours
 *     `addu $v0,$v0,$s0`.  In OUR OWN .combine, all three `ItemName[count]`
 *     sites are base-first (insn 340 `(plus (reg 223) (reg 222))`, insns
 *     437/465 `(plus (reg/v 99) (reg 245/256))`) and all match retail, while
 *     the one pointer site `menu_base[count]` is index-first (insn 1189
 *     `(plus (reg 307) (reg/v 100))`).  Cause: `ItemName[count]` on an ARRAY
 *     builds an ARRAY_REF, expanded via get_inner_reference as
 *     `gen_rtx (PLUS, ptr_mode, XEXP (op0, 0), force_reg (ptr_mode,
 *     offset_rtx))` — base first by construction; `menu_base[count]` on a
 *     POINTER builds INDIRECT_REF(PLUS_EXPR(ptr, idx*size)) and comes out
 *     index-first.  Same C syntax, different tree, different addu order.
 *     Swapping to `ItemName[count]` here is NOT free: cse2 resets its table at
 *     .L8005B880, so the array form rematerialises `addiu ...,sp,1424` (+1
 *     insn, wrong length) instead of reusing $s0.  Needs a form that keeps the
 *     menu_base REG as the base while taking the ARRAY_REF path.
 *
 * (5) (C)'s last byte at 0x81c stands where round 9 left it: retail inits the
 *     think cursor from menu_base ($s0), we use item ($s1).  Round 9's
 *     reg_in_basic_block_p argument kills both directions for a menu_base READ
 *     at 0x81c.  NOT re-opened this round.  One untried angle is recorded: the
 *     set could reach loop.c gate 1 via case (3) instead of case (1) if
 *     `menu_base = ItemName` were placed where maybe_never == 0 (before loop
 *     2's first conditional jump) — but that requires a named temp for
 *     `ThinkDB[0].name` to keep the ThinkDB base discovered FIRST, or the
 *     preheader order [ThinkDB high][ThinkDB lo_sum][menu_base] inverts.
 *
 * ROUND 10 (+-0): THE ROUND-9 LEAD ON (A) IS REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT, but the
 * SHAPE of retail's loop-1 is now PROVED rather than inferred.  Read this before
 * touching the call_spill hack again.
 *
 * (1) **THE HACK IS LOAD-BEARING.  "Delete it and let caller-save do it" FAILS.**
 *     MEASURED (E1b: both volatile if/else pairs, both stores, and the
 *     `call_spill[2]` field deleted; `blood` a plain VECTOR; nothing else
 *     touched): LENGTH 1136 (-4 insns), frame 0x808.  gcc does NOT caller-save
 *     the bases — it hands them CALLEE-SAVED regs (`addiu $fp,$2,%lo(
 *     StageAppearance)` / `addiu $23,$2,%lo(WeaponModel)`, i.e. $fp and $s7),
 *     the mask stays 0xc0ff0000, and there is no sw/lw around sprintf at all.
 *     This also REFUTES an inherited round-5 claim that has been quoted as
 *     settled fact for five rounds: "With `blood.call_spill[]` deleted entirely,
 *     gcc spilled them on its own to sp+0x7e0/sp+0x7e4 — byte-identical slots."
 *     It does not.  It spills NOTHING.  Do not re-derive this.
 *
 * (2) **RETAIL NEVERTHELESS HAS NO HACK — now proved two independent ways, not
 *     inferred from slot coincidence** (the old argument was circular: round 5
 *     SIZED the struct so its slots would land on 0x7e0/0x7e4).
 *      - FRAME ARITHMETIC.  No-hack user locals end at 0x7e0 (names 0x18 +1400,
 *        ItemName 0x590 +560, pos 0x7c0 +16, blood VECTOR 0x7d0 +16).  Retail's
 *        saved regs start at 0x7e8 and its frame is 0x810 = 0x7e0 + 8 + 40.
 *        That 8 is exactly TWO compiler-allocated caller-save slots.  E1b's
 *        measured 0x808 = 0x7e0 + 0 + 40 is the same sum with ZERO slots.
 *      - CALLER-SAVE SIGNATURE.  Retail: `sw $t0,0x7E0($sp)` / `jal sprintf` /
 *        `sw $t1,0x7E4($sp)` — the second save sits IN THE JAL DELAY SLOT — and
 *        the restores `lw $t1,0x7E4` / `lw $t0,0x7E0` come at the block END in
 *        REVERSE order.  No source store is ever emitted that way; that is
 *        caller-save.c + dbr.  Retail's t0/t1 are genuinely allocator spills.
 *
 * (3) **THE RETAIL SHAPE IS REACHABLE AND MEASURED — and it is NOT a near-win.**
 *     E3 = direct refs (`StageAppearance[stage_slot]`, `WeaponModel[weapon]`,
 *     direct guard `if (WeaponModel[0].wid != -1)`), no named base vars, no hack,
 *     KEEPING rounds 6-9's fences and the if/else cursor.  MEASURED: LENGTH 1144
 *     (-2), frame 0x810 (retail's), and the loop-1 preheader is retail's EXACT
 *     seven insns in retail's EXACT order —
 *         lui/addiu SA -> $t0 ; li -1 ; addiu HD ; lui/addiu WM -> $fp ; giv
 *     i.e. [SA][-1][HD][WM][giv].  (A)'s ORDER falls out for free, and ONE base
 *     is already correctly caller-saved: `sw $8,2016($sp)` (0x7e0) IN THE JAL
 *     DELAY SLOT, reloaded after — retail's mechanism, reproduced.
 *     E3 SUPERSEDES round 5's recorded "direct refs AND a direct guard = 1136
 *     (-4)": with rounds 6-9's fences kept it is 1144 (-2), two insns better.
 *     **BUT `tools/asmdiff.py` scores E3 at 107 residual lines in 49 blocks vs
 *     this checkpoint's 10 lines in 8 blocks.**  Fixing (A)'s order rotates the
 *     WHOLE loop-1 allocation.  E3 is not 2 insns from a match; it is a
 *     different, much worse point that happens to have the right preheader.
 *     Do NOT adopt E3 as a checkpoint on the strength of its order alone.
 *
 * (4) **WHY E3 IS 2 INSNS SHORT — exact, from `tools/regalloc.py`.**  Retail
 *     caller-saves BOTH bases (4 insns: 2 sw + 2 lw); E3 caller-saves ONE.  The
 *     two lowest-priority allocnos are
 *         p128 (SA base): 5 refs / 200 insns -> 500  -> $t0  (lost, caller-saved)
 *         p181 (WM base): 5 refs / 192 insns -> 520  -> $fp  (took the LAST free
 *                                                             callee-saved reg)
 *     Eight allocnos fill $s0-$s7, p181 takes $fp, p128 gets nothing.  Retail
 *     has NINE allocnos above the bases (s0=HumanData entry, s1=buffer,
 *     s2=weapon, s3=j, s4=i, s5=count, s6=-1, s7=names giv, fp=HumanData base),
 *     so BOTH bases lose and — because allocation is priority DESC — the higher
 *     one (WM) takes $t0 and SA takes $t1, which is retail's exact pairing.
 *     **The whole of (A) therefore reduces to: find ONE more loop-1 allocno with
 *     priority > 520 that takes $fp.**  Note retail's `weapon`/`j` do NOT cross
 *     sprintf (checked: no $s2/$s3 between the jal and .L8005B76C) — they simply
 *     WIN callee-saved regs, so "make something cross the call" is not obviously
 *     the lever.  E3 also carries an allocno retail lacks: p182 (6/194 -> 618)
 *     is a live `%hi(WeaponModel)` CARRIER in $s7, reused later; retail
 *     rematerialises its `lui` into a throwaway $v0 instead.
 *
 * (5) ROUND 9's loop.c citation is IMPRECISE (the conclusion survives).  :708 is
 *     NOT a bare `n_times_set == 1` requirement — it is a DISJUNCTION,
 *     `n_times_set[...] == 1 || consec_sets_invariant_p (...)`, and it is the
 *     SECOND of two gates (the first is the cases (1)/(2)/(3) disjunction at
 *     :697-703).  Our hack still fails it (3 non-consecutive sets, and a
 *     volatile read is not invariant), and a named `weapon_base` independently
 *     fails gate 1 — which is why round 5's measured "`weapon_base = WeaponModel`
 *     written in the body: 1124 (-7)" happens, and why THE ROUND-9/10 BRIEF'S
 *     "relocate `weapon_base = WeaponModel` into the loop body" CANNOT WORK for a
 *     NAMED variable at any position: at the body top case (3) would need
 *     !maybe_never but it is then discovered FIRST (wrong order), and anywhere
 *     below the HumanData use maybe_never is already 1.  Only a compiler TEMP
 *     (case (2)) can be the movable — i.e. only E3.
 *
 * ROUND 9 (-7): cluster (C) was TWO INDEPENDENT HALVES, not one.  The brief's
 * "the $a0/$a1 swap at 0x830-0x85c is downstream of which name the cursor init
 * reads" is FALSE and cost three rounds.  Byte-account before believing it:
 *   - the $a0/$a1 swap (7 of C's 8 bytes) is a plain allocno_compare
 *     inequality between think_item (p101) and the ThinkDB cursor (p276);
 *   - only 0x81c's 1 remaining byte is the $s0/$s1 name question.
 * MIPS defines NO REG_ALLOC_ORDER, so find_reg walks hard regs NUMERICALLY and
 * the FIRST-allocated of two conflicting allocnos wins the lower register.
 * p101 and p276 conflict with each other and NEITHER conflicts with hard reg 4
 * or 5 (read `;; 101 conflicts:` / `;; 276 conflicts:` in .greg) — so both can
 * hold $a0 and ORDER alone decides.  Target: cursor=$a0, think_item=$a1.
 *
 * ROUND 9's ROOT CAUSE — **a MEGA-FENCE**, the mega-pseudo mistake one level up
 * and the direct analogue of the FENCE_10/_6 shared-macro problem round 8 fixed:
 * the depth-19 fence sat on `think_item = item`, a statement whose DEST is
 * think_item and whose SOURCE is item.  Round 6 tuned that ONE depth to give
 * `item` 27 refs and never noticed it ALSO launched think_item to the TOP of
 * the allocation order (34 refs -> 80952, above p276's 45000).  One site,
 * two allocnos, incompatible requirements.  **A fence weights every allocno the
 * statement MENTIONS, not just the one you are aiming at — check the source
 * operands too, and read the whole `;; N regs to allocate:` order line, not
 * just your target's priority.**
 *
 * ROUND 9's METHOD — an EXACT ref model, not a sweep.  flow.c adds loop_depth
 * per REG mention, so every count is predictable.  With G = guard-fence depth,
 * W = pre-loop block-wrap depth, d1 = `think_item = item` fence, F = `i = count`
 * fence, C = `category = 0` fence (live lengths from .greg):
 *     p276 (cursor)     = 3(2+G)            / 6
 *     p101 (think_item) = 4(2+G) + (2+G+d1) / 21
 *     p99  (item)       = 4(1+W) + 1 + (2+G+d1) / 71
 *     p80  (count)      = 38 + 4W + 3G      / 177
 *     p82  (i)          = 19 + F  + 3G      / 134
 *     p90  (category)   = 13 + C  + G       / 54
 *     p270 (ThinkDB lo_sum) = 1 + 2(2+G)    / 104
 *     p81  (type)       = 4 + W             / 76
 *     p265 (high ThinkDB)   = 4 + G         / 106
 *     p89 (think) = 26/62 = 16774 and p100 (menu_base) = 25/51 = 19607 are fixed.
 * priority = floor_log2(refs)*refs/live_length*10000 (global.c allocno_compare).
 * Every one of these reproduces ALL SIX measured configurations exactly; they
 * were FITTED to measurements, so re-fit rather than trust them if the source
 * changes.  The constraints that must hold simultaneously:
 *     p101 < p276                     (cursor takes $a0, think_item $a1)
 *     p99 > p90 > p82 > p80           (item $s1, category $s3, i $s4, count $s5)
 *     p90 < p89 (16774)               (think keeps $s2)
 *     p270 > p81 > p265               (lo_sum $s6, type $s7, high(ThinkDB) $fp)
 * A brute-force search over (G,W,d1,F,C) gives exactly 6 solutions, all G=2.
 * Round 9 uses **G=2, W=2, d1=11** (F=16, C=6 unchanged from round 6).
 *
 * ROUND 9's TWO NEW REUSABLE FENCE RULES (both measured, both general):
 *  - **BLOCK-WRAP.**  A fence is a sched1 barrier, so fencing ONE statement
 *    inside a densely sched1-interleaved block SPLITS the region and RELOCATES
 *    it.  Measured: a fence on `item = ItemName` alone pins it to the top of its
 *    region (0x7a8 -> 0x798) and costs +19 bytes — and every one of the three
 *    pre-loop sites that mention `item` does this, because sched interleaves all
 *    four statements there.  Wrapping the WHOLE block in ONE fence is instead
 *    region-NEUTRAL (one region in, one region out) and moves nothing: it buys
 *    the weights for free.  That is what W does.
 *  - **DEEPENING AN EXISTING FENCE IS FREE; ADDING A NEW ONE IS NOT.**  A deeper
 *    fence at a site that already has one adds no new barrier — only weight.
 *    That is why G (the guard fence, already present at depth 1) is the safe
 *    dial and a brand-new fence anywhere in the pre-loop block is not.
 *
 * ROUND 9 CORRECTS THE BRIEF ON (C)'s CONTRADICTION — it is STRONGER, not
 * weaker, than round 8 thought, and the round-9 lead is a dead end.
 * `reg_in_basic_block_p` (loop.c:1066, READ IT) has a SECOND test that every
 * previous round missed: after the `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) != INSN_UID (insn)`
 * check it walks forward from the set and returns 0 at the first CODE_LABEL,
 * BARRIER, or non-last-use JUMP_INSN — i.e. **the reg's LAST use must be in the
 * SAME basic block as the set**.  So for a menu_base read at 0x81c BOTH
 * directions are dead, not one:
 *   - set AFTER 0x81c  -> REGNO_FIRST_UID fails (the read is the first mention);
 *   - set BEFORE 0x81c -> the last use (the AdtSelect arg at 0x894) is past the
 *     scan's CODE_LABELs, so the basic-block test fails.
 * The brief's round-9 lead is REAL but INSUFFICIENT: `reg_scan` does run once at
 * loop_optimize:392, before the `for (i = max_loop_num-1; i >= 0; i--)` at :438
 * (verified in the pinned source), so REGNO_FIRST_UID is never refreshed between
 * loops — but no post-reg_scan pass can author the 0x81c read anyway.  cse2 is
 * the only candidate (it is what rewrites 0x7f8's hoist into `move s0,s1`) and
 * it CANNOT: cse resets its table at every CODE_LABEL (`new_basic_block`), and
 * 0x81c sits after loop 2's top label, in a different cse block from the
 * preheader where reg100 == fp+1424 is known.  That is exactly why round 5's
 * `think_item = ItemName` rematerialised `addiu a1,sp,1424` instead.
 * **Do not spend another round on 0x81c's last byte via loop.c or cse2.**
 *
 * ROUND 9 ON (A), for the next round: (A) is a movable DISCOVERY-ORDER problem
 * and the mechanism is now understood.  Target [SA][-1][HD][WM][giv] vs ours
 * [SA][WM][-1][HD][giv].  Ours has BOTH `kind_base = StageAppearance` and
 * `weapon_base = WeaponModel` as PRE-LOOP statements, so they are emitted in
 * source order BEFORE the hoists (hoists use emit_insn_before(loop_start)).
 * The target's WM lands AFTER the hoists, so the target's WM is a MOVABLE
 * discovered at its first use — and loop 1's body would discover exactly
 * SA -> -1 -> HD -> WM, the target's order.  **The blocker is OURS, not loop.c:**
 * `weapon_base` is REASSIGNED by the `blood.call_spill[]` volatile hack, so
 * n_times_set != 1 and loop.c can never make it a movable (loop.c:708 requires
 * `n_times_set[REGNO (SET_DEST (set))] == 1`).  Retail's WeaponModel/
 * StageAppearance spills at sp+0x7e0/0x7e4 are exactly where the ALLOCATOR's
 * caller-save would put them, so retail almost certainly has no such hack.
 * The round-10 experiment: delete the call_spill hack, let caller-save do it,
 * and relocate `weapon_base = WeaponModel` into the loop body below the
 * HumanData use.  Untried — it is a real restructure, not a dial.
 * >>> ROUND 10 RAN IT: **REFUTED, both halves.**  Deleting the hack does not let
 * caller-save do anything (1136, bases -> $fp/$s7, no spill at all), and a
 * relocated NAMED `weapon_base` fails loop.c's FIRST gate at any position (1124).
 * The mechanism above is right that our hack blocks the movable; it is wrong that
 * removing it is sufficient.  Only a compiler TEMP can be the movable — see the
 * ROUND 10 block at the top of this comment for E3 and the exact remaining gap.
 *
 * ROUND 6 (-10): loop 2's preheader ORDER, carrier, base and type are now ALL
 * EXACT.  Three things had to be true at once; each alone measured worse:
 *  (1) `menu_base = ItemName` RELOCATED from a pre-loop statement to a
 *      statement inside the do-while, below the think scan.  A hoist is
 *      emitted with emit_insn_before(loop_start) — i.e. AFTER every pre-loop
 *      statement — so a pre-loop `menu_base` can NEVER follow the hoists.
 *      Relocated, it becomes a third movable discovered after the base's, and
 *      move_movables emits movables in discovery order (loop.c appends:
 *      `last_movable->next = m`).  Round 5 found this; alone it is 97.
 *  (2) `think_item = item`, NOT `= ItemName` (round 5) and NOT `= menu_base`.
 *      This is the whole trick.  loop.c:691-703 case (1) is
 *      `reg_in_basic_block_p`, whose FIRST test is
 *      `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) != INSN_UID (insn) -> return 0`: the set must
 *      be the reg's FIRST mention in the WHOLE function.  So a relocated
 *      `menu_base` cannot be read earlier in the loop — `think_item =
 *      menu_base` kills the hoist outright.  Round 5 therefore wrote
 *      `think_item = ItemName`, which cse2 rematerialises as
 *      `addiu a1,sp,1424`.  Reading `item` instead satisfies BOTH: menu_base
 *      keeps no earlier mention (case (1) holds, the hoist lands after the
 *      base), AND `item` stays LIVE across the loop, so cse2 still rewrites
 *      the hoisted `menu_base = ItemName` into `move s0,s1`, and — the
 *      cascade retail depends on — the ThinkDB base can no longer reuse $s1,
 *      taking $s6, pushing the carrier to $s8 and type to $s7.  All exact.
 *      This alone is 84: correct structure, pure 4-cycle rename left.
 *  (3) ADD_ENEMY_FENCE_19 on `think_item = item`.  Keeping `item` live costs
 *      it priority (8 refs / 71 insns -> 3380 vs category's 20/54 -> 14814),
 *      which rotated {item,category,i,count} through {s5,s1,s3,s4}.  ONE
 *      ballast site fixes the whole cycle: `tools/regalloc.py AddEnemy
 *      --between 99 90 95 --enclosed-refs 1` says "+19..+20 weighted refs",
 *      and depth 19 lands item at 27 refs -> 15211, above category (14814)
 *      and below p95 (16000).  Order becomes item,category,i,count = retail's
 *      s1,s3,s4,s5.  Do NOT overshoot: 32 refs crosses a floor_log2 step
 *      (4->5) and doubles the priority.
 *
 * ROUND 6 DISPROOF — the brief's two "diagnosed costs" were both WRONG, and
 * both are cheap to re-check, so do not re-derive them:
 *  - "The item/category swap is an allocno_compare inequality; add ballast"
 *    is FALSE for round 5's structure.  Dropping `category = 0` to FENCE_5
 *    flips the allocation ORDER exactly as the arithmetic predicts
 *    (`... 93 95 90 82 80 ...` -> `... 93 95 82 90 80 ...`) and changes NOT
 *    ONE BYTE, because round-5's `item` allocno carries hard regs 16 AND 17
 *    in its CONFLICT list — it cannot hold $s1 at any priority.  A swap is
 *    only a priority question once you have checked the loser CAN hold the
 *    winner's register.  Read the conflict list BEFORE computing priorities.
 *  - "0x8005b81c needs menu_base's value known inside the loop, yet deleting
 *    menu_base removes the copy" was a real contradiction, and `think_item =
 *    item` dissolves it: the copy's source and the cursor's source are the
 *    SAME value under TWO names, and the name each site reads is what decides
 *    both the hoist and the cascade.  0x81c is now exact.
 *
 * ROUND 8 — the fence macros are EXPANDED (mega-expansion).  Every fence is
 * now literal nested do{}while(0) text at its call site, with the depth in a
 * comment.  This is byte-neutral BY CONSTRUCTION (cpp expands textually) and
 * was verified three ways: the preprocessed token stream is IDENTICAL (1702
 * tokens both sides), the recompiled AddEnemy.c.o came out byte-identical (the
 * build skipped every downstream rule), and matchdiff stayed at 42.
 * WHY IT MATTERS HERE, concretely: ADD_ENEMY_FENCE_10 had THREE call sites and
 * _6 had TWO, so those sites were forced to share one depth — the mega-pseudo
 * mistake one level up.  Depth is this file's main allocator dial, and a shared
 * macro made "raise site X only" inexpressible.  Expanded, each site is an
 * independent dial and any depth (7, 8, 11, ...) is reachable without minting a
 * macro.  Do NOT re-introduce a fence macro; keep the literal text.
 *
 * ROUND 8 also CONFIRMED round 7's byte accounting independently (the first
 * inherited accounting in this file to survive re-measurement): A=14, B=6, C=8,
 * D=2, E=12 = 42, computed by counting differing bytes per instruction.
 *
 * ROUND 8's PER-SITE DEPTH SWEEP (do not re-run; each entry is a rebuild +
 * matchdiff).  Depth 0 = fence removed entirely:
 *     weapon++             0/6/8/10/12/16 -> 42 42 42 42 42 42   DEAD, REMOVED
 *     category = 0                      0 -> 86
 *     i = count                         0 -> 76
 *     menu_char = ...                   0 -> 86
 *     think_item = item                 0 -> 84
 *     menu_base[count].name = 0  0/6/8/10+ -> 72 54 42 42        plateau at >=8
 *     think |= AdtSelect(...)  0/6/8/10/12/16 -> 93 70 51 42 42 54
 * Every surviving fence is load-bearing.  The sites are independently sensitive
 * with DIFFERENT curves and optima (menu_base flattens above 8; think|= peaks in
 * a narrow 10-12 window and regresses on BOTH sides), which is the mega-pseudo
 * mechanism made visible — but depth 10 already sat at each site's optimum, so
 * the shared macro was costing nothing.  Expansion bought the measurement and
 * one dead fence, not bytes.  An honest partial refutation: the hypothesis's
 * MECHANISM is real here, its PREDICTION (hidden bytes) was not.
 *
 * ROUND 8 DISPROOF — "0x7f8 is a GIV INIT" IS FALSE, and so is the question
 * "what makes $s0 a giv of the outer loop?".  Read from the .loop dump
 * (`tools/rtldump.py AddEnemy --draft --pass loop`), not inferred:
 *  - AddEnemy has exactly TWO real loops: `Loop from 691 to 1639: 60 real
 *    insns` (the outer do-while) and `Loop from 31 to 540: 150 real insns`
 *    (loop 1).  Everything else is `is phony` — 79 of them, one per fence
 *    do{}while(0).
 *  - **THE THINK SCAN IS NOT A LOOP TO loop.c.**  It is written as a goto-loop,
 *    so it has no NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG and loop.c never sees it.  Round 7's
 *    "0x81c is the last insn of the INNER scan loop's preheader (0x810-0x81c:
 *    menu_char hoisted out of the scan)" and "the canonical giv-init slot" are
 *    FICTIONS: there is no inner loop, no inner preheader, and no hoist there.
 *    0x810-0x81c are plain source statements, which is exactly why they match.
 *  - Loop 2's section contains NO biv and NO giv line at all.  `category` is
 *    not recognised as a biv, so there is no biv in loop 2 for $s0 to be a giv
 *    OF.  (Loop 1 is the only loop with induction vars: `Reg 80: biv verified`,
 *    and `giv at 408 reduced to (reg:SI 372)` is the mult-20 names cursor.)
 *  - 0x7f8 IS A HOIST, logged verbatim:
 *        Insn 905:  regno 265 (life 24) ... moved to 1805   <- high(ThinkDB)
 *        Insn 1243: regno 270 (life 22) ... moved to 1807   <- lo_sum, $s6
 *        Insn 1333: regno 100 (life 67), savings 1 moved to 1808  <- menu_base
 *    i.e. move_movables, three movables, menu_base THIRD — exactly what round 6
 *    engineered.  The preheader ORDER IS ALREADY CORRECT and (C) is NOT an
 *    order problem; 0x7f0/0x7f4/0x7f8 are all out of the diff.
 *
 * ROUND 8, two inherited FACTS corrected (both cheap to re-check, do not
 * re-derive):
 *  - **pseudo 100 is `menu_base`, NOT `item`.**  The round-5 note "cse2 rewrites
 *    to a copy of `item` (pseudo 100, $s1)" misnames it.  The dump shows insn
 *    1333/1808 SETS reg 100, and it is the hoisted `menu_base = ItemName`.
 *  - **"loop.c cannot hoist a frame-address invariant (sp+K)" is HALF WRONG as
 *    written.**  loop.c hoists one RIGHT HERE.  The hoisted insn is literally
 *        (insn 1808 ... (set (reg/v:SI 100)
 *                            (plus:SI (reg:SI 30 $fp) (const_int 1424))))
 *    — a frame address, and `reg/v` = REG_USERVAR_P.  The true rule is round
 *    7's own final clause, not its headline: a frame address is folded into one
 *    addiu per use ONLY while no named variable holds it; a NAMED variable
 *    creates a real invariant SET that case (1) hoists normally.  What cannot
 *    happen is the case-(2) route (a compiler TEMP), because cse never leaves
 *    sp+K in a temp.
 *  - Corollary worth keeping: `move s0,s1` is NOT what loop.c emitted.  loop.c
 *    emitted `reg100 = fp+1424`; CSE2 then rewrote it to a copy of the
 *    equivalent register ($s1) because the preheader is one cse2 block.  Never
 *    reason about 0x7f8 from the final mnemonic — read the .loop dump.
 *
 * SO WHAT (C) ACTUALLY IS, stated exactly.  $s0 = reg100 = menu_base (hoisted,
 * born 0x7f8).  $s1 = ItemName pre-loop.  Both hold the same value.  The whole
 * of (C) is WHICH NAME the cursor init reads: target `think_item = <$s0>`, ours
 * `think_item = item` -> $s1; the $a0/$a1 swap at 0x830-0x85c is downstream of
 * that one choice.  Round 8's contribution is to make the constraint exact,
 * from the verified loop.c text (gcc-2.8.1 tarball in the nix store —
 * /nix/store/117i80brbgcdmcl46gmpzwizikbjyx5m-gcc-2.8.1.tar.gz/loop.c, READ IT,
 * it settles these questions in minutes):
 *   (i)   menu_base must be hoisted THIRD  <=> its SET is discovered after the
 *         lo_sum's set, and the lo_sum's set is created at the first INDEXED
 *         `ThinkDB[i]`, which is inside the scan.
 *   (ii)  case (1) is the only live disjunct (case (2) needs a non-uservar;
 *         case (3) needs !maybe_never, and loop.c:922-931 — CONFIRMED verbatim
 *         against the real source — sets maybe_never past ANY CODE_LABEL or
 *         JUMP_INSN, so everything after the guard is poisoned).
 *   (iii) case (1) demands `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) == INSN_UID (set)` — the set
 *         must be the reg's FIRST mention in the WHOLE function.
 * Reading menu_base at 0x81c therefore requires set < 0x81c < first ThinkDB[i]
 * < set.  **A CONTRADICTION** — so (C) is UNSATISFIABLE for a named menu_base,
 * confirming round 7's conclusion while destroying its escape hatch.
 *
 * THE ONE UNTRIED LEVER, and the round-9 lead.  The contradiction has exactly
 * one soft term: "the lo_sum's set is created at the first indexed ThinkDB[i],
 * inside the scan".  Move that set EARLIER — before 0x81c — and the ordering
 * becomes satisfiable: menu_base's set can then sit after the lo_sum and still
 * precede its own first read.  That needs an indexed `ThinkDB[<non-const>]`
 * reference between the guard and the cursor init (the guard itself cannot do
 * it: `ThinkDB[0]` folds its %lo into the load — `lw $v0,%lo(ThinkDB)($fp)` at
 * 0x800 — which creates the CARRIER movable but no lo_sum, and that folding is
 * exactly what retail's shared-carrier form depends on).
 * ALSO STILL OPEN and independent of the above: reg_scan runs ONCE, at
 * loop_optimize:62, BEFORE the `for (i = max_loop_num-1; i >= 0; i--)` loop at
 * :108 — so REGNO_FIRST_UID is never refreshed between loops.  Any read created
 * by a pass AFTER reg_scan is INVISIBLE to (iii).  That is the only known way to
 * read menu_base at 0x81c without killing the hoist, and it is why the giv idea
 * was attractive; it just cannot be a giv HERE (no biv in loop 2).  If some
 * other post-reg_scan pass can be made to author that read, (C) falls.
 *
 * ROUND 7 — byte accounting CORRECTED, and (C) re-diagnosed from the gcc
 * source.  Round 6's cluster table summed to 48, not 42, and its per-cluster
 * counts were each wrong; it also claimed "0x81c is now exact" when 0x81c is
 * in the diff.  Byte-account with matchdiff before trusting any of this.
 * The residual AS OF ROUND 9 (re-byte-accounted per instruction after the -7:
 * 14+6+1+2+12 = 35, so this is the whole of it).  (C) was 8 and is now 1:
 * 0x830/0x834/0x84c/0x850/0x858/0x85c are GONE and 0x81c is down to one byte.
 * The round-7 text below is kept for its (A)/(B)/(D)/(E) diagnoses; its (C)
 * entry and its "8 bytes" are superseded by the ROUND 9 block at the top.
 *   (A) 14 bytes, 0x5d4-0x5e0 (4 insns): loop-1 preheader ORDER.  Target
 *       [SA][-1][HD][WM][giv]; ours [SA][WM][-1][HD][giv].  Only the
 *       WeaponModel base pair is out of place.  Registers IDENTICAL.
 *   (B)  6 bytes, 0x620-0x624 (2 insns): `move s3,zero` / `sll v1,s4,0x10`
 *       swapped.  Registers IDENTICAL; a sched order pick.
 *   (C)  8 bytes, 0x81c-0x85c (7 insns): an $a0/$a1 swap AND a source-register
 *       difference.  Target `move a1,s0` reads $s0 (the loop-2 base); ours
 *       `move a0,s1` reads $s1 (`item`).  Round 6 fixed only the FORM.
 *   (D)  2 bytes, 0x884 (1 insn): `addu v0,s0,v0` vs ours `addu v0,v0,s0`.
 *   (E) 12 bytes, 0x8dc-0x8e4 (3 insns): `move a0,s7` is FIRST in the exit
 *       block; ours is third, after the CamState la.  Registers IDENTICAL.
 *
 * The la/extern-completion rule does NOT apply anywhere here (checked, round
 * 7): no differing byte is a lui/addiu differing only in destination reg.
 * 0x8e0/0x8e4 are the same-register (unsplit) form on BOTH sides and differ
 * only in position; 0x5d4-0x5e0's pair is split identically on both sides.
 * `.extern CamState, 36` is already complete.  autorules re-run on THIS
 * source (round 6 changed the program materially): 46 candidates, no win.
 *
 * (C) IS UNREACHABLE VIA ANY loop.c MOVABLE — proved from the gcc 2.8.1
 * source, not inferred.  loop.c:697-703 makes a set movable if ANY of:
 *     (3) ! maybe_never && ! loop_reg_used_before_p (...)
 *     (2) ! REG_USERVAR_P (SET_DEST) && ! REG_LOOP_TEST_P (SET_DEST)
 *     (1) reg_in_basic_block_p (p, SET_DEST)
 * and each is independently dead for the loop-2 base:
 *  - case (3): loop.c:922-931 sets `maybe_never = 1` past ANY CODE_LABEL *or*
 *    JUMP_INSN (only a loop-top simplejump is exempt) — NOT merely backward
 *    jumps, which is the half-rule that has been assumed here.  The
 *    `if (ThinkDB[0].name != 0)` branch therefore poisons everything after it.
 *  - case (2): needs a compiler temp.  MEASURED (round 7): deleting menu_base
 *    and using direct `ItemName[...]` gives 1144, and the .s shows why — the
 *    address is rematerialised as `addu $reg,$sp,1424` at ALL FOUR sites and
 *    never hoisted at all.  NEW RULE, worth generalising: **loop.c cannot
 *    hoist a frame-address invariant (`sp+K`).  cse/combine fold it into one
 *    cheap addiu per use, so there is no invariant SET for move_movables to
 *    move, and case (2) can never engage.  A frame address becomes a register
 *    ONLY as a NAMED user variable via case (1).**
 *  - case (1): reg_in_basic_block_p's first test is
 *    `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) != INSN_UID (insn) -> return 0`, so the set must
 *    be the reg's first mention in the WHOLE function — it forbids the scan
 *    reading the base.  CONFIRMED by measurement: `think_item = menu_base`
 *    alone is LENGTH 1156 (+1 insn, the hoist dies).
 * And the ORDER pins case (1) as the only survivor: the ThinkDB *base*
 * (lo_sum, $s6) is discovered at the first INDEXED `ThinkDB[i]` (0x830), which
 * is INSIDE the scan — the `ThinkDB[0]` guard folds its %lo into the load
 * (`lw $v0,%lo(ThinkDB)($fp)`) and creates only the *carrier* movable.  So the
 * base must be discovered after the scan to land 3rd in the preheader, i.e.
 * its set must sit after the scan, i.e. it can never be read inside the scan.
 * {hoisted 3rd in the preheader} AND {read inside the scan} is UNSATISFIABLE.
 *
 * SO 0x7f8's `move s0,s1` IS A GIV INIT, NOT A HOIST.  strength_reduce
 * (loop.c:6405) emits giv inits with emit_insn_before(loop_start) AFTER
 * move_movables has run — the ONLY mechanism that can legally land after every
 * hoist in a preheader (this file already proved it once, for loop 1's
 * `addu s7,s5,zero` at 0x5e4).  Two independent pieces of target evidence:
 *  - $s0 holds -1 at 0x7c0 (`addiu $s0,$zero,-0x1`, feeding the `type == -1`
 *    test at 0x7e4), so $s0 is BORN at 0x7f8 — it is not a pre-loop pointer.
 *  - 0x81c's `addu $a1,$s0,$zero` is the last insn of the INNER scan loop's
 *    preheader (0x810-0x81c: menu_char hoisted out of the scan, then the
 *    copy), immediately before .L8005B820 — the canonical giv-init slot, and
 *    the same `reg = reg` shape as loop 1's giv init.  The scan cursor is
 *    loop.c's giv of `count` (base + count*8, count==0 at entry), exactly as
 *    `names_offset` turned out to be in loop 1.
 * ROUND 8 should therefore ask what makes $s0 a GIV of the OUTER loop, not
 * where to put a `menu_base` statement.  Do NOT re-run fence-depth work on
 * (C) (round 6's own proof: item's allocno conflicts with hard regs 16 AND 17,
 * so it cannot hold $s1 at any priority) and do NOT re-site menu_base as a
 * movable (proved unsatisfiable above).
 *
 * (E) is likewise not a statement-order lever.  gcc 2.8's sched is a BACKWARD
 * list scheduler (dump reads T-1 = block END; only the block-end insn is ready
 * initially), and `rank_for_schedule` is priority DESC, then class, then
 * DESCENDING LUID.  In block 32 the CamState `high` (insn 1607) already has
 * priority 1 — the floor — so to be emitted first `move a0,s7` must be picked
 * last, needing either priority < 1 (impossible) or a LOWER LUID than 1607
 * (impossible: expand_call emits hard-reg arg moves only after every arg is
 * evaluated).  Reordering the tail statements cannot move it; (E) needs the
 * CamState chain to carry priority > 1, i.e. a different dependency shape.
 *
 * The stack is exact: names at sp+0x18, ItemName at sp+0x590, output VECTOR at
 * sp+0x7c0, and the zeroed blood VECTOR at sp+0x7d0.
 *
 * Explicit top-tested stage-kind, weapon, and think scans recover retail's
 * loop rotation.  StageAppearance and WeaponModel remain in t1/t0 and spill
 * at sp+0x7e4/sp+0x7e0 around sprintf.  A CFG join retains the weapon wid
 * reload.  i/s4 is reused across both menu scans and count/x share s5.
 * Narrow single-trip fences steer those live ranges but emit no instructions.
 *
 * Closed this pass (-20): THERE IS NO `names_offset` VARIABLE.  The names
 * cursor is loop.c's own strength-reduced GIV of `count`: `names_offset` and
 * `count` are updated in lockstep (both only on the success path, both from
 * 0), so `names_offset == count * 20` identically and the source is simply
 * `buffer = (char *)names[count]`.  Spelling it as a hand-written biv put
 * TWO things in the wrong place at once, and writing `names[count]` fixed
 * both for free:
 *  (1) its init.  A source `names_offset = 0` is a PRE-loop statement, and
 *      loop.c emits hoists with emit_insn_before(loop_start) — i.e. after
 *      every pre-loop statement — so the init could only ever precede the
 *      hoists.  Retail has it LAST in the preheader (`addu s7,s5,zero` at
 *      0x8005b5e4) because strength_reduce (loop.c:6405) emits giv inits
 *      before loop_start AFTER move_movables has already run.  A giv init is
 *      the ONLY thing that can legally sit after a hoist in a preheader.
 *  (2) its increment.  As a giv, `addiu s7,s7,20` is emitted at the biv's
 *      update point rather than mid-block, which stops sched1 floating it up
 *      to 0x8005b6fc and lets dbr fill sprintf's delay slot with it exactly
 *      as retail does (0x8005b738).  That alone was a 16-byte cluster.
 *
 * Closed this pass (-44 bytes), as ONE atomic three-part edit — each part
 * alone breaks the 288-insn length, which is why they were parked separately:
 *  (1) `names_offset` was a MEGA-PSEUDO: one s32 local doing two unrelated
 *      jobs (the names cursor `=0`/`+=20`, and the AdtSelect result reused as
 *      `type`).  Three reaching defs stop combine's num_sign_bit_copies from
 *      proving sign-extension, forcing a narrow on BreedLife's arg0.  Giving
 *      `type` its OWN single-assignment local drops that narrow (-1 insn).
 *      The earlier pass FUSED them deliberately to chase the demo symbol's
 *      "$s7 type"; the allocator lands both in s7 anyway once split, because
 *      the ranges are disjoint.  Forcing a register by source reuse is what
 *      created the conflict.
 *  (2) `think` is `s16` (PSX.SYM: `reg $s2 short think`), not a cast s32.
 *  (3) the update is `think = think | AdtSelect(...)` with NO cast at the
 *      assignment; the loop test and leSetEnemy arg narrow per-use.
 * (2)+(3) restore retail's OR-temp `move s2,v0` (+1 insn), which a previous
 * pass recorded as an un-forceable coalescing tie.  It is forceable: as a
 * HImode store the copy's SOURCE ($v0, the OR result) stays LIVE past the
 * copy because the comparison sign-extends from $v0 (`sll v0,v0,16`), not
 * from the accumulator.  optimize_reg_copy_1 only rewrites the producer when
 * the copy's source DIES at the copy, so it declines here.  Spelling the
 * accumulator differently never moved it; changing which value the compare
 * reads did.
 *
 * `think_base` was deleted (byte-neutral): retail's $s6 ThinkDB base is a
 * loop.c-hoisted invariant of the indexed `ThinkDB[i]` accesses, not a source
 * pointer, which is why the guard keeps its own `%lo(ThinkDB)($fp)` form.
 *
 * Closed this pass (-9): the think/category $s2/$s3 SWAP was an
 * `allocno_compare` inequality, computed from the dumps rather than guessed
 * (cookbook: "A pure callee-saved SWAP residual is an allocno_compare
 * inequality — add ballast").  `.lreg` gives
 *     think    (pseudo 90, reg/v:HI): 26 refs / 62 insns -> 4*26/62 = 16774
 *     category (pseudo 91, reg/v:HI): 24 refs / 54 insns -> 4*24/54 = 17778
 * and `.greg`'s allocation order shows it literally ("... 91 90 ..."):
 * category outranks think and takes $s2 first.  category was over-ballasted
 * by its OWN fence — flow.c weights every ref by loop_depth, so FENCE_10 on
 * `category = 0` bought ~10 weighted refs for a single set.  Dropping that one
 * site to FENCE_6 costs 4 weighted refs, puts think ahead, and emits nothing.
 * A fence's DEPTH is a tunable dial, not a boolean: prefer the smallest depth
 * that wins the inequality, and compute both priorities before touching it.
 *
 * CORRECTED (round 3 got this wrong, and it cost a round): the residual was
 * NOT "register naming only" and NOT one cause.  Byte-accounting the diff by
 * cluster is a 5-minute check that would have caught it: of the 72, a full 40
 * lay in loop 1 / the prologue with IDENTICAL registers on both sides,
 * differing only in ORDER — they could not possibly be caused by loop 2's
 * preheader.  Always attribute the bytes to clusters BEFORE adopting a
 * single-cause story; a story that explains a third of the residual is not a
 * theory of the residual.
 *
 * Remaining residual (52), byte-accounted EXACTLY (round 5; sums to 52, so it
 * is the whole residual, not a story about part of it):
 *   (A) 14 bytes, 0x5d4-0x5e0 (4 insns): loop-1 preheader ORDER only.
 *   (B)  6 bytes, 0x620-0x624 (2 insns): `move s3,zero` / `sll v1,s4,0x10`
 *        swapped.  Registers IDENTICAL; a scheduling order pick.
 *   (C) 32 bytes, 0x7e0-0x924 (13 insns): the loop-2 base/type/carrier
 *        rotation, driven by the preheader order.  See below.
 *
 * ROUND 5 DISPROOF — do not re-run the round-4/5 loop-1 theory.  The brief
 * asked "find retail's two extra long-lived values, because retail keeps
 * ELEVEN to our NINE and its bases sit in t0/t1 because they LOST".  That is
 * FALSE for this checkpoint, and byte-accounting shows it in five minutes:
 * cluster (A) has IDENTICAL registers on both sides.  Ours already emits
 *     lui v0,%hi(StageAppearance) / addiu $t1,... / li $s6,-1 /
 *     addiu $fp,$a0,%lo(HumanData) / lui v0,%hi(WeaponModel) / addiu $t0,... /
 *     addu $s7,$s5,$zero
 * i.e. kind_base ALREADY in $t1, weapon_base ALREADY in $t0, -1 in $s6,
 * HumanData in $fp, giv init last — retail's exact seven insns in retail's
 * exact registers.  The caller-saves are already present and the length is
 * already exact.  WE ALREADY KEEP ELEVEN.  There are no two missing
 * long-lived values.  The nine-vs-eleven deficit belongs only to the
 * *retail-shaped edit* (direct refs + direct guard), a different program that
 * drops the call_spill range-split and so lets the bases win callee-saved
 * regs.  Reapplying it trades a SOLVED allocation for an order fix (-4).
 * Loop 1 is an ORDER problem, and only an order problem.
 *
 * The loop-2 rotation: both preheaders hold the SAME three
 * instructions in a different ORDER (target 0x8005b7f0, block 22):
 *     target: lui s8 / addiu s6,s8,-25024 / move s0,s1
 *     ours:   move s0,s1 / lui s7         / addiu s1,s7,-25024
 * `move s0,s1` is insn 714, `menu_base = ItemName`, which cse2 rewrites to a
 * copy of `item` (pseudo 100, $s1) — and 100 DIES there.  Retail's base is
 * born BEFORE that death, so base and `item` overlap, the base cannot reuse
 * $s1, and it takes $s6; that pushes type $s6->$s7 and the %hi carrier
 * $s7->$s8.  Ours frees $s1 one insn early, so the base reuses it and no
 * cascade happens.  Fix the ORDER and all 72 bytes should follow.
 *
 * Why the order resists: loop.c emits the hoists (insn 1662 `high(ThinkDB)`
 * = carrier, insn 1664 `lo_sum` = base) with emit_insn_before(loop_start),
 * i.e. immediately before NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG and therefore AFTER every
 * pre-loop statement.  `menu_base = ItemName` is pre-loop source, so it can
 * only ever precede them unless sched1 swaps — and sched1 will not.
 *
 * NEW, and the reason a fence is never "zero-cost": in gcc 2.8
 * `sched_analyze_insn`, a NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END in mid-block is a FULL
 * scheduling barrier (it must be, or the loop_depth that weights reg_n_refs
 * would go wrong) — every following insn gains a dependency on all prior
 * sets.  So a do{}while(0) fence has TWO effects: ref ballast AND a hard
 * sched1 order pin.  Proof here: insn 1662's LOG_LINKS is `(insn_list 714)`,
 * a dependency with no data behind it, purely the FENCE_10's notes.  Fences
 * therefore freeze the emitted order of the statements they wrap.
 *
 * ROUND 5, loop 2: THE ORDER IS REACHABLE — proved, then reverted.  The lead
 * above is correct and it works.  Moving `menu_base = ItemName` from a
 * pre-loop statement to a statement INSIDE the do-while, placed after the
 * think scan (i.e. after the base's movable in body-scan order), and
 * initialising the cursor with `think_item = ItemName` instead of
 * `= menu_base`, emits (verified in the .s):
 *     addu $17,$18,$zero / lui $23,%hi(ThinkDB) / addiu $21,$23,%lo(ThinkDB)
 *     / addu $16,$19,$zero / addu $20,$0,$zero
 * against retail's
 *     addu $s3,$s2,$zero / lui $fp,%hi(ThinkDB) / addiu $s6,$fp,%lo(ThinkDB)
 *     / addu $s0,$s1,$zero / addu $s5,$zero,$zero
 * — the SAME five insns in the SAME order, menu_base landing in retail's $s0,
 * and the guard still reusing the carrier (`lw $2,%lo(ThinkDB)($23)`).  The
 * mechanism is loop.c:691-703 case (1), `reg_in_basic_block_p`: it is a
 * STANDALONE disjunct that does NOT require !maybe_never and does NOT care
 * that the dest is a user variable, so a NAMED `menu_base` hoists freely
 * provided every use sits in the set's own basic block.  (That is why the
 * "named user var blocks the hoist" rule below is only half the story: it
 * blocks via cases (2)/(3), and case (1) buys it back.)
 *
 * It measured 97, NOT a reduction, so it was reverted.  Two costs, both
 * diagnosed, and they are the whole of the next round's work:
 *  (1) `item`/`category` swap ($s1<->$s3) plus a knock-on rotation of count
 *      (s5->s4), i (s4->s3), j (s3->s5), base (s6->s5), carrier (fp->s7),
 *      type (s7->s6).  A pure allocno_compare inequality — the pattern this
 *      file already beat once at -9.  `.greg` order was
 *      `29 regs to allocate: 277 92 87 276 98 86 314 101 100 89 93 95 90 82
 *       80 88 96 83 99 85 91 94 140 120 270 372 141 81 265`.
 *  (2) 0x8005b81c: retail `move a1,s0` (think_item = a copy of menu_base) vs
 *      ours `addiu a1,sp,1424` — cse2 REMATERIALISES the frame address
 *      because it clears its table at the multi-predecessor loop head, so it
 *      never learns $s0 == sp+1424 inside the loop.
 * Deleting `menu_base` entirely (all uses direct `ItemName[...]`) does NOT
 * fix (2): the copy stops existing at all and the length goes to 1144 (-2).
 * So `move s0,s1` exists ONLY because a NAMED menu_base exists, yet retail's
 * 0x81c needs that name's value known INSIDE the loop.  Reconciling those two
 * is the open question; the order lever itself is solved and cheap to redo.
 *
 * NEW RULE (measured here, worth generalising): a do{}while(0) fence CANNOT
 * ballast a set that loop.c HOISTS.  move_movables emits the insn with
 * emit_insn_before(loop_start), which lifts it OUT of the fence's
 * NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END region, so it loses the loop_depth weighting
 * entirely.  Wrapping the relocated `menu_base = ItemName` in FENCE_10
 * changed nothing (97 -> 97).  Ballast only works on sets that STAY PUT.
 *
 * LOOP-1 PREHEADER, and the general rule it establishes.  Retail's order is
 *     [StageAppearance base] [-1] [HumanData base] [WeaponModel base] [giv]
 * and ours is
 *     [StageAppearance base] [WeaponModel base] [-1] [HumanData base] [giv]
 * i.e. the ONLY thing left out of place is the WeaponModel base.  Round 3
 * called this shape unreachable because loop.c emits every hoist after every
 * pre-loop statement.  That is true but it is the wrong lever: the fix is to
 * stop the value being a pre-loop statement at all.  move_movables emits
 * movables in BODY-SCAN DISCOVERY order, so a loop-invariant assignment
 * written INSIDE the body lands at its scan position.  Our body scan order is
 * already StageAppearance -> -1 -> HumanData -> WeaponModel, exactly retail's.
 * THE RULE (read this before touching loop 1 again — it is why a NAMED base
 * can never be hoisted).  loop.c:691-703 will only move a set if one of:
 *     (1) it is used only in the same basic block as the set, OR
 *     (2) `! REG_USERVAR_P (SET_DEST (set)) && ! REG_LOOP_TEST_P (...)`, OR
 *     (3) the set is guaranteed executed once the loop starts and the reg is
 *         not used until after that.
 * So **assigning a loop invariant to a NAMED USER VARIABLE blocks the hoist**
 * whenever the value is also used in another block and the set sits under a
 * conditional (`maybe_never`).  A compiler TEMP — what a direct indexed
 * reference like `WeaponModel[weapon].name` or `WeaponModel[0].wid` produces —
 * takes case (2) and hoists freely.  This one flag explains every loop-1
 * result, including two that look contradictory:
 *  - `weapon_base = WeaponModel;` written in the body: 1124 (-7).  User var,
 *    maybe_never, multi-block -> all three cases fail -> not hoisted at all.
 *  - direct refs but keeping `weapon_entry = WeaponModel;`: 1140 (-3).  The
 *    lo_sum's dest is the user var, so only the *temp* `high` hoists and each
 *    `%lo` is folded into its use.
 *  - direct refs AND a direct guard `if (WeaponModel[0].wid != -1)` (retail's
 *    own shape: `lh $v0,0x4($t0)` at 0x6a4, cursor `addu $v1,$t0,$zero` at
 *    0x6d0): the guard's indexed load creates the temp FIRST, cse1 then makes
 *    the later `weapon_entry = WeaponModel` a copy of it, and the whole lo_sum
 *    hoists.  **This reproduces retail's loop-1 preheader EXACTLY** — same 7
 *    insns, same order, giv init last.  Verified in the .s.
 *
 * That shape is 1136 (-4), and the -4 is fully diagnosed: it is exactly the
 * four caller-save insns (2 `sw` + 2 `lw`).  Our masks are IDENTICAL to
 * retail's (0xc0ff0000 = s0-s7+fp+ra), but retail keeps ELEVEN long-lived
 * values (those nine PLUS t0/t1) where we keep nine, so our two bases outrank
 * retail's and grab callee-saved regs instead of being pushed into caller-
 * saved t0/t1.  Retail's bases are in t0/t1 *because they lost*: `find_reg`
 * gave them no callee-saved reg, and caller-save.c then spilled them.
 * SUPERSEDED by the ROUND 5 DISPROOF above: this paragraph's premise ("our
 * bases outrank retail's and win callee-saved regs") is true ONLY of the
 * retail-shaped edit, never of this checkpoint, whose bases are already in
 * t0/t1.  Do not go looking for "two extra long-lived values" — we already
 * keep eleven.  Loop 1's 20 bytes are order, not pressure.  The real loop-1
 * question is the same one loop 2 answers: how to emit the WeaponModel base
 * as a movable discovered AFTER the -1/HumanData movables while KEEPING the
 * t0 allocation and the four caller-saves that the named-var shape earns.
 *
 * ALSO CONFIRMED, and it retires a piece of scaffolding: the two `sw` around
 * sprintf are gcc's CALLER-SAVE of the two bases, not source stores.  With
 * `blood.call_spill[]` deleted entirely, gcc spilled them on its own to
 * sp+0x7e0 / sp+0x7e4 — byte-identical slots to the hand-written hack, which
 * is why the hack ever looked right.  `call_spill` and the volatile-reload
 * if/else pair are therefore MODELLING A COMPILER PASS and must go with the
 * edit above; they are kept here only because the 52 checkpoint needs the
 * exact length and that edit is -4 until the allocation is solved.
 *
 * Rejected (do not repeat): folding the stage slot, narrowing the weapon id,
 * eliminating the weapon CFG join, the s8-next_j allocation hack (autorules
 * now scores it 1004 — a clear length regression, not the recorded -2), and
 * menu_base[count]->ItemName[count] (recomputes the base, +2).
 * Rejected THIS pass, each measured:
 *  - `menu_base = ItemName` moved to the loop-body TOP: 119.  loop.c hoists
 *    movables in discovery order, so at the top it is still found before the
 *    base's and the order does not flip.
 *  - `think_base` as a real source pointer for the indexed accesses: LENGTH
 *    +1 (1156).  It breaks the carrier SHARING — the `ThinkDB[0]` guard stops
 *    reusing the hoisted %hi and emits its own `lui v0` / `lw v0,-25024(v0)`
 *    where retail has one `lw v0,-25024(s8)`.  This is why the base must stay
 *    a loop.c-hoisted invariant, confirming the earlier note.
 *  - Unfencing `menu_base = ItemName` to drop the sched1 pin: 119.  The order
 *    does NOT flip (sched1 still keeps 714 first) and `item` loses $s1.
 *  - Relocating that ballast to FENCE_10(think_item = menu_base): 126.
 *  - autorules: no improving edit among 50 candidates.
 *  - Bounded permuter (420s, -j4, --stop-on-zero): no zero.
 * Rejected in ROUND 7, each measured on THIS source (not inherited claims):
 *  - `think_item = menu_base` (one word, everything else unchanged): LENGTH
 *    1156.  The case-(1) hoist dies exactly as predicted.  This is the first
 *    independent confirmation of round 6's rule; it holds.
 *  - Deleting `menu_base` again, all loop-2 uses direct `ItemName[...]`, on
 *    the round-6 structure (NOT a repeat of round 5 — the program changed):
 *    LENGTH 1144, same as round 5.  The result is robust, and the .s finally
 *    explains it: four `addu $reg,$sp,1424`, no hoist anywhere.
 *  - autorules on the round-6 source: 46 candidates, no improving edit.
 * Rejected in ROUND 5, each measured (see the loop-2 note above for detail):
 *  - `menu_base = ItemName` relocated below the think scan + `think_item =
 *    ItemName`: 97.  ORDER CORRECT (this is the advance), but it costs the
 *    item/category swap and 0x81c rematerialises.  Redo it only WITH a fix
 *    for those two; the shape itself is right.
 *  - FENCE_10 on that relocated statement, to restore item's lost ballast:
 *    97 (no change) — a hoisted set escapes its fence's notes.
 *  - Deleting `menu_base` entirely, all uses direct `ItemName[...]`: LENGTH
 *    1144 (-2).  The `move s0,s1` copy stops being emitted at all.
