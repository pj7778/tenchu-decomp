/*
 * STATUS: NON_MATCHING — complete pure-C reconstruction at the exact target
 * extent (1152 bytes / 288 instructions) and exact 0x810 frame.  The guarded
 * draft has 42 differing bytes (183 -> 161 -> 125 -> 81 -> 72 -> 52 -> 42).
 *
 * ROUND 6 (-10): loop 2's preheader ORDER, carrier, base and type are now ALL
 * EXACT.  Three things had to be true at once; each alone measured worse:
 *  (1) `menu_base = ItemName` RELOCATED from a pre-loop statement to a
 *      statement inside the do-while, below the think scan.  A hoist is
 *      emitted with emit_insn_before(loop_start) — i.e. AFTER every pre-loop
 *      statement — so a pre-loop `menu_base` can NEVER follow the hoists.
 *      Relocated, it becomes a third movable discovered after the base's, and
 *      move_movables emits movables in discovery order (loop.c appends:
 *      `last_movable->next = m`).  Round 5 found this; alone it is 97.
 *  (2) `think_item = item`, NOT `= ItemName` (round 5) and NOT `= menu_base`.
 *      This is the whole trick.  loop.c:691-703 case (1) is
 *      `reg_in_basic_block_p`, whose FIRST test is
 *      `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) != INSN_UID (insn) -> return 0`: the set must
 *      be the reg's FIRST mention in the WHOLE function.  So a relocated
 *      `menu_base` cannot be read earlier in the loop — `think_item =
 *      menu_base` kills the hoist outright.  Round 5 therefore wrote
 *      `think_item = ItemName`, which cse2 rematerialises as
 *      `addiu a1,sp,1424`.  Reading `item` instead satisfies BOTH: menu_base
 *      keeps no earlier mention (case (1) holds, the hoist lands after the
 *      base), AND `item` stays LIVE across the loop, so cse2 still rewrites
 *      the hoisted `menu_base = ItemName` into `move s0,s1`, and — the
 *      cascade retail depends on — the ThinkDB base can no longer reuse $s1,
 *      taking $s6, pushing the carrier to $s8 and type to $s7.  All exact.
 *      This alone is 84: correct structure, pure 4-cycle rename left.
 *  (3) ADD_ENEMY_FENCE_19 on `think_item = item`.  Keeping `item` live costs
 *      it priority (8 refs / 71 insns -> 3380 vs category's 20/54 -> 14814),
 *      which rotated {item,category,i,count} through {s5,s1,s3,s4}.  ONE
 *      ballast site fixes the whole cycle: `tools/regalloc.py AddEnemy
 *      --between 99 90 95 --enclosed-refs 1` says "+19..+20 weighted refs",
 *      and depth 19 lands item at 27 refs -> 15211, above category (14814)
 *      and below p95 (16000).  Order becomes item,category,i,count = retail's
 *      s1,s3,s4,s5.  Do NOT overshoot: 32 refs crosses a floor_log2 step
 *      (4->5) and doubles the priority.
 *
 * ROUND 6 DISPROOF — the brief's two "diagnosed costs" were both WRONG, and
 * both are cheap to re-check, so do not re-derive them:
 *  - "The item/category swap is an allocno_compare inequality; add ballast"
 *    is FALSE for round 5's structure.  Dropping `category = 0` to FENCE_5
 *    flips the allocation ORDER exactly as the arithmetic predicts
 *    (`... 93 95 90 82 80 ...` -> `... 93 95 82 90 80 ...`) and changes NOT
 *    ONE BYTE, because round-5's `item` allocno carries hard regs 16 AND 17
 *    in its CONFLICT list — it cannot hold $s1 at any priority.  A swap is
 *    only a priority question once you have checked the loser CAN hold the
 *    winner's register.  Read the conflict list BEFORE computing priorities.
 *  - "0x8005b81c needs menu_base's value known inside the loop, yet deleting
 *    menu_base removes the copy" was a real contradiction, and `think_item =
 *    item` dissolves it: the copy's source and the cursor's source are the
 *    SAME value under TWO names, and the name each site reads is what decides
 *    both the hoist and the cascade.  0x81c is now exact.
 *
 * ROUND 8 — the fence macros are EXPANDED (mega-expansion).  Every fence is
 * now literal nested do{}while(0) text at its call site, with the depth in a
 * comment.  This is byte-neutral BY CONSTRUCTION (cpp expands textually) and
 * was verified three ways: the preprocessed token stream is IDENTICAL (1702
 * tokens both sides), the recompiled AddEnemy.c.o came out byte-identical (the
 * build skipped every downstream rule), and matchdiff stayed at 42.
 * WHY IT MATTERS HERE, concretely: ADD_ENEMY_FENCE_10 had THREE call sites and
 * _6 had TWO, so those sites were forced to share one depth — the mega-pseudo
 * mistake one level up.  Depth is this file's main allocator dial, and a shared
 * macro made "raise site X only" inexpressible.  Expanded, each site is an
 * independent dial and any depth (7, 8, 11, ...) is reachable without minting a
 * macro.  Do NOT re-introduce a fence macro; keep the literal text.
 *
 * ROUND 8 also CONFIRMED round 7's byte accounting independently (the first
 * inherited accounting in this file to survive re-measurement): A=14, B=6, C=8,
 * D=2, E=12 = 42, computed by counting differing bytes per instruction.
 *
 * ROUND 8's PER-SITE DEPTH SWEEP (do not re-run; each entry is a rebuild +
 * matchdiff).  Depth 0 = fence removed entirely:
 *     weapon++             0/6/8/10/12/16 -> 42 42 42 42 42 42   DEAD, REMOVED
 *     category = 0                      0 -> 86
 *     i = count                         0 -> 76
 *     menu_char = ...                   0 -> 86
 *     think_item = item                 0 -> 84
 *     menu_base[count].name = 0  0/6/8/10+ -> 72 54 42 42        plateau at >=8
 *     think |= AdtSelect(...)  0/6/8/10/12/16 -> 93 70 51 42 42 54
 * Every surviving fence is load-bearing.  The sites are independently sensitive
 * with DIFFERENT curves and optima (menu_base flattens above 8; think|= peaks in
 * a narrow 10-12 window and regresses on BOTH sides), which is the mega-pseudo
 * mechanism made visible — but depth 10 already sat at each site's optimum, so
 * the shared macro was costing nothing.  Expansion bought the measurement and
 * one dead fence, not bytes.  An honest partial refutation: the hypothesis's
 * MECHANISM is real here, its PREDICTION (hidden bytes) was not.
 *
 * ROUND 8 DISPROOF — "0x7f8 is a GIV INIT" IS FALSE, and so is the question
 * "what makes $s0 a giv of the outer loop?".  Read from the .loop dump
 * (`tools/rtldump.py AddEnemy --draft --pass loop`), not inferred:
 *  - AddEnemy has exactly TWO real loops: `Loop from 691 to 1639: 60 real
 *    insns` (the outer do-while) and `Loop from 31 to 540: 150 real insns`
 *    (loop 1).  Everything else is `is phony` — 79 of them, one per fence
 *    do{}while(0).
 *  - **THE THINK SCAN IS NOT A LOOP TO loop.c.**  It is written as a goto-loop,
 *    so it has no NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG and loop.c never sees it.  Round 7's
 *    "0x81c is the last insn of the INNER scan loop's preheader (0x810-0x81c:
 *    menu_char hoisted out of the scan)" and "the canonical giv-init slot" are
 *    FICTIONS: there is no inner loop, no inner preheader, and no hoist there.
 *    0x810-0x81c are plain source statements, which is exactly why they match.
 *  - Loop 2's section contains NO biv and NO giv line at all.  `category` is
 *    not recognised as a biv, so there is no biv in loop 2 for $s0 to be a giv
 *    OF.  (Loop 1 is the only loop with induction vars: `Reg 80: biv verified`,
 *    and `giv at 408 reduced to (reg:SI 372)` is the mult-20 names cursor.)
 *  - 0x7f8 IS A HOIST, logged verbatim:
 *        Insn 905:  regno 265 (life 24) ... moved to 1805   <- high(ThinkDB)
 *        Insn 1243: regno 270 (life 22) ... moved to 1807   <- lo_sum, $s6
 *        Insn 1333: regno 100 (life 67), savings 1 moved to 1808  <- menu_base
 *    i.e. move_movables, three movables, menu_base THIRD — exactly what round 6
 *    engineered.  The preheader ORDER IS ALREADY CORRECT and (C) is NOT an
 *    order problem; 0x7f0/0x7f4/0x7f8 are all out of the diff.
 *
 * ROUND 8, two inherited FACTS corrected (both cheap to re-check, do not
 * re-derive):
 *  - **pseudo 100 is `menu_base`, NOT `item`.**  The round-5 note "cse2 rewrites
 *    to a copy of `item` (pseudo 100, $s1)" misnames it.  The dump shows insn
 *    1333/1808 SETS reg 100, and it is the hoisted `menu_base = ItemName`.
 *  - **"loop.c cannot hoist a frame-address invariant (sp+K)" is HALF WRONG as
 *    written.**  loop.c hoists one RIGHT HERE.  The hoisted insn is literally
 *        (insn 1808 ... (set (reg/v:SI 100)
 *                            (plus:SI (reg:SI 30 $fp) (const_int 1424))))
 *    — a frame address, and `reg/v` = REG_USERVAR_P.  The true rule is round
 *    7's own final clause, not its headline: a frame address is folded into one
 *    addiu per use ONLY while no named variable holds it; a NAMED variable
 *    creates a real invariant SET that case (1) hoists normally.  What cannot
 *    happen is the case-(2) route (a compiler TEMP), because cse never leaves
 *    sp+K in a temp.
 *  - Corollary worth keeping: `move s0,s1` is NOT what loop.c emitted.  loop.c
 *    emitted `reg100 = fp+1424`; CSE2 then rewrote it to a copy of the
 *    equivalent register ($s1) because the preheader is one cse2 block.  Never
 *    reason about 0x7f8 from the final mnemonic — read the .loop dump.
 *
 * SO WHAT (C) ACTUALLY IS, stated exactly.  $s0 = reg100 = menu_base (hoisted,
 * born 0x7f8).  $s1 = ItemName pre-loop.  Both hold the same value.  The whole
 * of (C) is WHICH NAME the cursor init reads: target `think_item = <$s0>`, ours
 * `think_item = item` -> $s1; the $a0/$a1 swap at 0x830-0x85c is downstream of
 * that one choice.  Round 8's contribution is to make the constraint exact,
 * from the verified loop.c text (gcc-2.8.1 tarball in the nix store —
 * /nix/store/117i80brbgcdmcl46gmpzwizikbjyx5m-gcc-2.8.1.tar.gz/loop.c, READ IT,
 * it settles these questions in minutes):
 *   (i)   menu_base must be hoisted THIRD  <=> its SET is discovered after the
 *         lo_sum's set, and the lo_sum's set is created at the first INDEXED
 *         `ThinkDB[i]`, which is inside the scan.
 *   (ii)  case (1) is the only live disjunct (case (2) needs a non-uservar;
 *         case (3) needs !maybe_never, and loop.c:922-931 — CONFIRMED verbatim
 *         against the real source — sets maybe_never past ANY CODE_LABEL or
 *         JUMP_INSN, so everything after the guard is poisoned).
 *   (iii) case (1) demands `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) == INSN_UID (set)` — the set
 *         must be the reg's FIRST mention in the WHOLE function.
 * Reading menu_base at 0x81c therefore requires set < 0x81c < first ThinkDB[i]
 * < set.  **A CONTRADICTION** — so (C) is UNSATISFIABLE for a named menu_base,
 * confirming round 7's conclusion while destroying its escape hatch.
 *
 * THE ONE UNTRIED LEVER, and the round-9 lead.  The contradiction has exactly
 * one soft term: "the lo_sum's set is created at the first indexed ThinkDB[i],
 * inside the scan".  Move that set EARLIER — before 0x81c — and the ordering
 * becomes satisfiable: menu_base's set can then sit after the lo_sum and still
 * precede its own first read.  That needs an indexed `ThinkDB[<non-const>]`
 * reference between the guard and the cursor init (the guard itself cannot do
 * it: `ThinkDB[0]` folds its %lo into the load — `lw $v0,%lo(ThinkDB)($fp)` at
 * 0x800 — which creates the CARRIER movable but no lo_sum, and that folding is
 * exactly what retail's shared-carrier form depends on).
 * ALSO STILL OPEN and independent of the above: reg_scan runs ONCE, at
 * loop_optimize:62, BEFORE the `for (i = max_loop_num-1; i >= 0; i--)` loop at
 * :108 — so REGNO_FIRST_UID is never refreshed between loops.  Any read created
 * by a pass AFTER reg_scan is INVISIBLE to (iii).  That is the only known way to
 * read menu_base at 0x81c without killing the hoist, and it is why the giv idea
 * was attractive; it just cannot be a giv HERE (no biv in loop 2).  If some
 * other post-reg_scan pass can be made to author that read, (C) falls.
 *
 * ROUND 7 — byte accounting CORRECTED, and (C) re-diagnosed from the gcc
 * source.  Round 6's cluster table summed to 48, not 42, and its per-cluster
 * counts were each wrong; it also claimed "0x81c is now exact" when 0x81c is
 * in the diff.  Byte-account with matchdiff before trusting any of this.
 * The REAL residual (verified: 14+6+8+2+12 = 42, so this is the whole of it):
 *   (A) 14 bytes, 0x5d4-0x5e0 (4 insns): loop-1 preheader ORDER.  Target
 *       [SA][-1][HD][WM][giv]; ours [SA][WM][-1][HD][giv].  Only the
 *       WeaponModel base pair is out of place.  Registers IDENTICAL.
 *   (B)  6 bytes, 0x620-0x624 (2 insns): `move s3,zero` / `sll v1,s4,0x10`
 *       swapped.  Registers IDENTICAL; a sched order pick.
 *   (C)  8 bytes, 0x81c-0x85c (7 insns): an $a0/$a1 swap AND a source-register
 *       difference.  Target `move a1,s0` reads $s0 (the loop-2 base); ours
 *       `move a0,s1` reads $s1 (`item`).  Round 6 fixed only the FORM.
 *   (D)  2 bytes, 0x884 (1 insn): `addu v0,s0,v0` vs ours `addu v0,v0,s0`.
 *   (E) 12 bytes, 0x8dc-0x8e4 (3 insns): `move a0,s7` is FIRST in the exit
 *       block; ours is third, after the CamState la.  Registers IDENTICAL.
 *
 * The la/extern-completion rule does NOT apply anywhere here (checked, round
 * 7): no differing byte is a lui/addiu differing only in destination reg.
 * 0x8e0/0x8e4 are the same-register (unsplit) form on BOTH sides and differ
 * only in position; 0x5d4-0x5e0's pair is split identically on both sides.
 * `.extern CamState, 36` is already complete.  autorules re-run on THIS
 * source (round 6 changed the program materially): 46 candidates, no win.
 *
 * (C) IS UNREACHABLE VIA ANY loop.c MOVABLE — proved from the gcc 2.8.1
 * source, not inferred.  loop.c:697-703 makes a set movable if ANY of:
 *     (3) ! maybe_never && ! loop_reg_used_before_p (...)
 *     (2) ! REG_USERVAR_P (SET_DEST) && ! REG_LOOP_TEST_P (SET_DEST)
 *     (1) reg_in_basic_block_p (p, SET_DEST)
 * and each is independently dead for the loop-2 base:
 *  - case (3): loop.c:922-931 sets `maybe_never = 1` past ANY CODE_LABEL *or*
 *    JUMP_INSN (only a loop-top simplejump is exempt) — NOT merely backward
 *    jumps, which is the half-rule that has been assumed here.  The
 *    `if (ThinkDB[0].name != 0)` branch therefore poisons everything after it.
 *  - case (2): needs a compiler temp.  MEASURED (round 7): deleting menu_base
 *    and using direct `ItemName[...]` gives 1144, and the .s shows why — the
 *    address is rematerialised as `addu $reg,$sp,1424` at ALL FOUR sites and
 *    never hoisted at all.  NEW RULE, worth generalising: **loop.c cannot
 *    hoist a frame-address invariant (`sp+K`).  cse/combine fold it into one
 *    cheap addiu per use, so there is no invariant SET for move_movables to
 *    move, and case (2) can never engage.  A frame address becomes a register
 *    ONLY as a NAMED user variable via case (1).**
 *  - case (1): reg_in_basic_block_p's first test is
 *    `REGNO_FIRST_UID (regno) != INSN_UID (insn) -> return 0`, so the set must
 *    be the reg's first mention in the WHOLE function — it forbids the scan
 *    reading the base.  CONFIRMED by measurement: `think_item = menu_base`
 *    alone is LENGTH 1156 (+1 insn, the hoist dies).
 * And the ORDER pins case (1) as the only survivor: the ThinkDB *base*
 * (lo_sum, $s6) is discovered at the first INDEXED `ThinkDB[i]` (0x830), which
 * is INSIDE the scan — the `ThinkDB[0]` guard folds its %lo into the load
 * (`lw $v0,%lo(ThinkDB)($fp)`) and creates only the *carrier* movable.  So the
 * base must be discovered after the scan to land 3rd in the preheader, i.e.
 * its set must sit after the scan, i.e. it can never be read inside the scan.
 * {hoisted 3rd in the preheader} AND {read inside the scan} is UNSATISFIABLE.
 *
 * SO 0x7f8's `move s0,s1` IS A GIV INIT, NOT A HOIST.  strength_reduce
 * (loop.c:6405) emits giv inits with emit_insn_before(loop_start) AFTER
 * move_movables has run — the ONLY mechanism that can legally land after every
 * hoist in a preheader (this file already proved it once, for loop 1's
 * `addu s7,s5,zero` at 0x5e4).  Two independent pieces of target evidence:
 *  - $s0 holds -1 at 0x7c0 (`addiu $s0,$zero,-0x1`, feeding the `type == -1`
 *    test at 0x7e4), so $s0 is BORN at 0x7f8 — it is not a pre-loop pointer.
 *  - 0x81c's `addu $a1,$s0,$zero` is the last insn of the INNER scan loop's
 *    preheader (0x810-0x81c: menu_char hoisted out of the scan, then the
 *    copy), immediately before .L8005B820 — the canonical giv-init slot, and
 *    the same `reg = reg` shape as loop 1's giv init.  The scan cursor is
 *    loop.c's giv of `count` (base + count*8, count==0 at entry), exactly as
 *    `names_offset` turned out to be in loop 1.
 * ROUND 8 should therefore ask what makes $s0 a GIV of the OUTER loop, not
 * where to put a `menu_base` statement.  Do NOT re-run fence-depth work on
 * (C) (round 6's own proof: item's allocno conflicts with hard regs 16 AND 17,
 * so it cannot hold $s1 at any priority) and do NOT re-site menu_base as a
 * movable (proved unsatisfiable above).
 *
 * (E) is likewise not a statement-order lever.  gcc 2.8's sched is a BACKWARD
 * list scheduler (dump reads T-1 = block END; only the block-end insn is ready
 * initially), and `rank_for_schedule` is priority DESC, then class, then
 * DESCENDING LUID.  In block 32 the CamState `high` (insn 1607) already has
 * priority 1 — the floor — so to be emitted first `move a0,s7` must be picked
 * last, needing either priority < 1 (impossible) or a LOWER LUID than 1607
 * (impossible: expand_call emits hard-reg arg moves only after every arg is
 * evaluated).  Reordering the tail statements cannot move it; (E) needs the
 * CamState chain to carry priority > 1, i.e. a different dependency shape.
 *
 * The stack is exact: names at sp+0x18, ItemName at sp+0x590, output VECTOR at
 * sp+0x7c0, and the zeroed blood VECTOR at sp+0x7d0.
 *
 * Explicit top-tested stage-kind, weapon, and think scans recover retail's
 * loop rotation.  StageAppearance and WeaponModel remain in t1/t0 and spill
 * at sp+0x7e4/sp+0x7e0 around sprintf.  A CFG join retains the weapon wid
 * reload.  i/s4 is reused across both menu scans and count/x share s5.
 * Narrow single-trip fences steer those live ranges but emit no instructions.
 *
 * Closed this pass (-20): THERE IS NO `names_offset` VARIABLE.  The names
 * cursor is loop.c's own strength-reduced GIV of `count`: `names_offset` and
 * `count` are updated in lockstep (both only on the success path, both from
 * 0), so `names_offset == count * 20` identically and the source is simply
 * `buffer = (char *)names[count]`.  Spelling it as a hand-written biv put
 * TWO things in the wrong place at once, and writing `names[count]` fixed
 * both for free:
 *  (1) its init.  A source `names_offset = 0` is a PRE-loop statement, and
 *      loop.c emits hoists with emit_insn_before(loop_start) — i.e. after
 *      every pre-loop statement — so the init could only ever precede the
 *      hoists.  Retail has it LAST in the preheader (`addu s7,s5,zero` at
 *      0x8005b5e4) because strength_reduce (loop.c:6405) emits giv inits
 *      before loop_start AFTER move_movables has already run.  A giv init is
 *      the ONLY thing that can legally sit after a hoist in a preheader.
 *  (2) its increment.  As a giv, `addiu s7,s7,20` is emitted at the biv's
 *      update point rather than mid-block, which stops sched1 floating it up
 *      to 0x8005b6fc and lets dbr fill sprintf's delay slot with it exactly
 *      as retail does (0x8005b738).  That alone was a 16-byte cluster.
 *
 * Closed this pass (-44 bytes), as ONE atomic three-part edit — each part
 * alone breaks the 288-insn length, which is why they were parked separately:
 *  (1) `names_offset` was a MEGA-PSEUDO: one s32 local doing two unrelated
 *      jobs (the names cursor `=0`/`+=20`, and the AdtSelect result reused as
 *      `type`).  Three reaching defs stop combine's num_sign_bit_copies from
 *      proving sign-extension, forcing a narrow on BreedLife's arg0.  Giving
 *      `type` its OWN single-assignment local drops that narrow (-1 insn).
 *      The earlier pass FUSED them deliberately to chase the demo symbol's
 *      "$s7 type"; the allocator lands both in s7 anyway once split, because
 *      the ranges are disjoint.  Forcing a register by source reuse is what
 *      created the conflict.
 *  (2) `think` is `s16` (PSX.SYM: `reg $s2 short think`), not a cast s32.
 *  (3) the update is `think = think | AdtSelect(...)` with NO cast at the
 *      assignment; the loop test and leSetEnemy arg narrow per-use.
 * (2)+(3) restore retail's OR-temp `move s2,v0` (+1 insn), which a previous
 * pass recorded as an un-forceable coalescing tie.  It is forceable: as a
 * HImode store the copy's SOURCE ($v0, the OR result) stays LIVE past the
 * copy because the comparison sign-extends from $v0 (`sll v0,v0,16`), not
 * from the accumulator.  optimize_reg_copy_1 only rewrites the producer when
 * the copy's source DIES at the copy, so it declines here.  Spelling the
 * accumulator differently never moved it; changing which value the compare
 * reads did.
 *
 * `think_base` was deleted (byte-neutral): retail's $s6 ThinkDB base is a
 * loop.c-hoisted invariant of the indexed `ThinkDB[i]` accesses, not a source
 * pointer, which is why the guard keeps its own `%lo(ThinkDB)($fp)` form.
 *
 * Closed this pass (-9): the think/category $s2/$s3 SWAP was an
 * `allocno_compare` inequality, computed from the dumps rather than guessed
 * (cookbook: "A pure callee-saved SWAP residual is an allocno_compare
 * inequality — add ballast").  `.lreg` gives
 *     think    (pseudo 90, reg/v:HI): 26 refs / 62 insns -> 4*26/62 = 16774
 *     category (pseudo 91, reg/v:HI): 24 refs / 54 insns -> 4*24/54 = 17778
 * and `.greg`'s allocation order shows it literally ("... 91 90 ..."):
 * category outranks think and takes $s2 first.  category was over-ballasted
 * by its OWN fence — flow.c weights every ref by loop_depth, so FENCE_10 on
 * `category = 0` bought ~10 weighted refs for a single set.  Dropping that one
 * site to FENCE_6 costs 4 weighted refs, puts think ahead, and emits nothing.
 * A fence's DEPTH is a tunable dial, not a boolean: prefer the smallest depth
 * that wins the inequality, and compute both priorities before touching it.
 *
 * CORRECTED (round 3 got this wrong, and it cost a round): the residual was
 * NOT "register naming only" and NOT one cause.  Byte-accounting the diff by
 * cluster is a 5-minute check that would have caught it: of the 72, a full 40
 * lay in loop 1 / the prologue with IDENTICAL registers on both sides,
 * differing only in ORDER — they could not possibly be caused by loop 2's
 * preheader.  Always attribute the bytes to clusters BEFORE adopting a
 * single-cause story; a story that explains a third of the residual is not a
 * theory of the residual.
 *
 * Remaining residual (52), byte-accounted EXACTLY (round 5; sums to 52, so it
 * is the whole residual, not a story about part of it):
 *   (A) 14 bytes, 0x5d4-0x5e0 (4 insns): loop-1 preheader ORDER only.
 *   (B)  6 bytes, 0x620-0x624 (2 insns): `move s3,zero` / `sll v1,s4,0x10`
 *        swapped.  Registers IDENTICAL; a scheduling order pick.
 *   (C) 32 bytes, 0x7e0-0x924 (13 insns): the loop-2 base/type/carrier
 *        rotation, driven by the preheader order.  See below.
 *
 * ROUND 5 DISPROOF — do not re-run the round-4/5 loop-1 theory.  The brief
 * asked "find retail's two extra long-lived values, because retail keeps
 * ELEVEN to our NINE and its bases sit in t0/t1 because they LOST".  That is
 * FALSE for this checkpoint, and byte-accounting shows it in five minutes:
 * cluster (A) has IDENTICAL registers on both sides.  Ours already emits
 *     lui v0,%hi(StageAppearance) / addiu $t1,... / li $s6,-1 /
 *     addiu $fp,$a0,%lo(HumanData) / lui v0,%hi(WeaponModel) / addiu $t0,... /
 *     addu $s7,$s5,$zero
 * i.e. kind_base ALREADY in $t1, weapon_base ALREADY in $t0, -1 in $s6,
 * HumanData in $fp, giv init last — retail's exact seven insns in retail's
 * exact registers.  The caller-saves are already present and the length is
 * already exact.  WE ALREADY KEEP ELEVEN.  There are no two missing
 * long-lived values.  The nine-vs-eleven deficit belongs only to the
 * *retail-shaped edit* (direct refs + direct guard), a different program that
 * drops the call_spill range-split and so lets the bases win callee-saved
 * regs.  Reapplying it trades a SOLVED allocation for an order fix (-4).
 * Loop 1 is an ORDER problem, and only an order problem.
 *
 * The loop-2 rotation: both preheaders hold the SAME three
 * instructions in a different ORDER (target 0x8005b7f0, block 22):
 *     target: lui s8 / addiu s6,s8,-25024 / move s0,s1
 *     ours:   move s0,s1 / lui s7         / addiu s1,s7,-25024
 * `move s0,s1` is insn 714, `menu_base = ItemName`, which cse2 rewrites to a
 * copy of `item` (pseudo 100, $s1) — and 100 DIES there.  Retail's base is
 * born BEFORE that death, so base and `item` overlap, the base cannot reuse
 * $s1, and it takes $s6; that pushes type $s6->$s7 and the %hi carrier
 * $s7->$s8.  Ours frees $s1 one insn early, so the base reuses it and no
 * cascade happens.  Fix the ORDER and all 72 bytes should follow.
 *
 * Why the order resists: loop.c emits the hoists (insn 1662 `high(ThinkDB)`
 * = carrier, insn 1664 `lo_sum` = base) with emit_insn_before(loop_start),
 * i.e. immediately before NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG and therefore AFTER every
 * pre-loop statement.  `menu_base = ItemName` is pre-loop source, so it can
 * only ever precede them unless sched1 swaps — and sched1 will not.
 *
 * NEW, and the reason a fence is never "zero-cost": in gcc 2.8
 * `sched_analyze_insn`, a NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END in mid-block is a FULL
 * scheduling barrier (it must be, or the loop_depth that weights reg_n_refs
 * would go wrong) — every following insn gains a dependency on all prior
 * sets.  So a do{}while(0) fence has TWO effects: ref ballast AND a hard
 * sched1 order pin.  Proof here: insn 1662's LOG_LINKS is `(insn_list 714)`,
 * a dependency with no data behind it, purely the FENCE_10's notes.  Fences
 * therefore freeze the emitted order of the statements they wrap.
 *
 * ROUND 5, loop 2: THE ORDER IS REACHABLE — proved, then reverted.  The lead
 * above is correct and it works.  Moving `menu_base = ItemName` from a
 * pre-loop statement to a statement INSIDE the do-while, placed after the
 * think scan (i.e. after the base's movable in body-scan order), and
 * initialising the cursor with `think_item = ItemName` instead of
 * `= menu_base`, emits (verified in the .s):
 *     addu $17,$18,$zero / lui $23,%hi(ThinkDB) / addiu $21,$23,%lo(ThinkDB)
 *     / addu $16,$19,$zero / addu $20,$0,$zero
 * against retail's
 *     addu $s3,$s2,$zero / lui $fp,%hi(ThinkDB) / addiu $s6,$fp,%lo(ThinkDB)
 *     / addu $s0,$s1,$zero / addu $s5,$zero,$zero
 * — the SAME five insns in the SAME order, menu_base landing in retail's $s0,
 * and the guard still reusing the carrier (`lw $2,%lo(ThinkDB)($23)`).  The
 * mechanism is loop.c:691-703 case (1), `reg_in_basic_block_p`: it is a
 * STANDALONE disjunct that does NOT require !maybe_never and does NOT care
 * that the dest is a user variable, so a NAMED `menu_base` hoists freely
 * provided every use sits in the set's own basic block.  (That is why the
 * "named user var blocks the hoist" rule below is only half the story: it
 * blocks via cases (2)/(3), and case (1) buys it back.)
 *
 * It measured 97, NOT a reduction, so it was reverted.  Two costs, both
 * diagnosed, and they are the whole of the next round's work:
 *  (1) `item`/`category` swap ($s1<->$s3) plus a knock-on rotation of count
 *      (s5->s4), i (s4->s3), j (s3->s5), base (s6->s5), carrier (fp->s7),
 *      type (s7->s6).  A pure allocno_compare inequality — the pattern this
 *      file already beat once at -9.  `.greg` order was
 *      `29 regs to allocate: 277 92 87 276 98 86 314 101 100 89 93 95 90 82
 *       80 88 96 83 99 85 91 94 140 120 270 372 141 81 265`.
 *  (2) 0x8005b81c: retail `move a1,s0` (think_item = a copy of menu_base) vs
 *      ours `addiu a1,sp,1424` — cse2 REMATERIALISES the frame address
 *      because it clears its table at the multi-predecessor loop head, so it
 *      never learns $s0 == sp+1424 inside the loop.
 * Deleting `menu_base` entirely (all uses direct `ItemName[...]`) does NOT
 * fix (2): the copy stops existing at all and the length goes to 1144 (-2).
 * So `move s0,s1` exists ONLY because a NAMED menu_base exists, yet retail's
 * 0x81c needs that name's value known INSIDE the loop.  Reconciling those two
 * is the open question; the order lever itself is solved and cheap to redo.
 *
 * NEW RULE (measured here, worth generalising): a do{}while(0) fence CANNOT
 * ballast a set that loop.c HOISTS.  move_movables emits the insn with
 * emit_insn_before(loop_start), which lifts it OUT of the fence's
 * NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END region, so it loses the loop_depth weighting
 * entirely.  Wrapping the relocated `menu_base = ItemName` in FENCE_10
 * changed nothing (97 -> 97).  Ballast only works on sets that STAY PUT.
 *
 * LOOP-1 PREHEADER, and the general rule it establishes.  Retail's order is
 *     [StageAppearance base] [-1] [HumanData base] [WeaponModel base] [giv]
 * and ours is
 *     [StageAppearance base] [WeaponModel base] [-1] [HumanData base] [giv]
 * i.e. the ONLY thing left out of place is the WeaponModel base.  Round 3
 * called this shape unreachable because loop.c emits every hoist after every
 * pre-loop statement.  That is true but it is the wrong lever: the fix is to
 * stop the value being a pre-loop statement at all.  move_movables emits
 * movables in BODY-SCAN DISCOVERY order, so a loop-invariant assignment
 * written INSIDE the body lands at its scan position.  Our body scan order is
 * already StageAppearance -> -1 -> HumanData -> WeaponModel, exactly retail's.
 * THE RULE (read this before touching loop 1 again — it is why a NAMED base
 * can never be hoisted).  loop.c:691-703 will only move a set if one of:
 *     (1) it is used only in the same basic block as the set, OR
 *     (2) `! REG_USERVAR_P (SET_DEST (set)) && ! REG_LOOP_TEST_P (...)`, OR
 *     (3) the set is guaranteed executed once the loop starts and the reg is
 *         not used until after that.
 * So **assigning a loop invariant to a NAMED USER VARIABLE blocks the hoist**
 * whenever the value is also used in another block and the set sits under a
 * conditional (`maybe_never`).  A compiler TEMP — what a direct indexed
 * reference like `WeaponModel[weapon].name` or `WeaponModel[0].wid` produces —
 * takes case (2) and hoists freely.  This one flag explains every loop-1
 * result, including two that look contradictory:
 *  - `weapon_base = WeaponModel;` written in the body: 1124 (-7).  User var,
 *    maybe_never, multi-block -> all three cases fail -> not hoisted at all.
 *  - direct refs but keeping `weapon_entry = WeaponModel;`: 1140 (-3).  The
 *    lo_sum's dest is the user var, so only the *temp* `high` hoists and each
 *    `%lo` is folded into its use.
 *  - direct refs AND a direct guard `if (WeaponModel[0].wid != -1)` (retail's
 *    own shape: `lh $v0,0x4($t0)` at 0x6a4, cursor `addu $v1,$t0,$zero` at
 *    0x6d0): the guard's indexed load creates the temp FIRST, cse1 then makes
 *    the later `weapon_entry = WeaponModel` a copy of it, and the whole lo_sum
 *    hoists.  **This reproduces retail's loop-1 preheader EXACTLY** — same 7
 *    insns, same order, giv init last.  Verified in the .s.
 *
 * That shape is 1136 (-4), and the -4 is fully diagnosed: it is exactly the
 * four caller-save insns (2 `sw` + 2 `lw`).  Our masks are IDENTICAL to
 * retail's (0xc0ff0000 = s0-s7+fp+ra), but retail keeps ELEVEN long-lived
 * values (those nine PLUS t0/t1) where we keep nine, so our two bases outrank
 * retail's and grab callee-saved regs instead of being pushed into caller-
 * saved t0/t1.  Retail's bases are in t0/t1 *because they lost*: `find_reg`
 * gave them no callee-saved reg, and caller-save.c then spilled them.
 * SUPERSEDED by the ROUND 5 DISPROOF above: this paragraph's premise ("our
 * bases outrank retail's and win callee-saved regs") is true ONLY of the
 * retail-shaped edit, never of this checkpoint, whose bases are already in
 * t0/t1.  Do not go looking for "two extra long-lived values" — we already
 * keep eleven.  Loop 1's 20 bytes are order, not pressure.  The real loop-1
 * question is the same one loop 2 answers: how to emit the WeaponModel base
 * as a movable discovered AFTER the -1/HumanData movables while KEEPING the
 * t0 allocation and the four caller-saves that the named-var shape earns.
 *
 * ALSO CONFIRMED, and it retires a piece of scaffolding: the two `sw` around
 * sprintf are gcc's CALLER-SAVE of the two bases, not source stores.  With
 * `blood.call_spill[]` deleted entirely, gcc spilled them on its own to
 * sp+0x7e0 / sp+0x7e4 — byte-identical slots to the hand-written hack, which
 * is why the hack ever looked right.  `call_spill` and the volatile-reload
 * if/else pair are therefore MODELLING A COMPILER PASS and must go with the
 * edit above; they are kept here only because the 52 checkpoint needs the
 * exact length and that edit is -4 until the allocation is solved.
 *
 * Rejected (do not repeat): folding the stage slot, narrowing the weapon id,
 * eliminating the weapon CFG join, the s8-next_j allocation hack (autorules
 * now scores it 1004 — a clear length regression, not the recorded -2), and
 * menu_base[count]->ItemName[count] (recomputes the base, +2).
 * Rejected THIS pass, each measured:
 *  - `menu_base = ItemName` moved to the loop-body TOP: 119.  loop.c hoists
 *    movables in discovery order, so at the top it is still found before the
 *    base's and the order does not flip.
 *  - `think_base` as a real source pointer for the indexed accesses: LENGTH
 *    +1 (1156).  It breaks the carrier SHARING — the `ThinkDB[0]` guard stops
 *    reusing the hoisted %hi and emits its own `lui v0` / `lw v0,-25024(v0)`
 *    where retail has one `lw v0,-25024(s8)`.  This is why the base must stay
 *    a loop.c-hoisted invariant, confirming the earlier note.
 *  - Unfencing `menu_base = ItemName` to drop the sched1 pin: 119.  The order
 *    does NOT flip (sched1 still keeps 714 first) and `item` loses $s1.
 *  - Relocating that ballast to FENCE_10(think_item = menu_base): 126.
 *  - autorules: no improving edit among 50 candidates.
 *  - Bounded permuter (420s, -j4, --stop-on-zero): no zero.
 * Rejected in ROUND 7, each measured on THIS source (not inherited claims):
 *  - `think_item = menu_base` (one word, everything else unchanged): LENGTH
 *    1156.  The case-(1) hoist dies exactly as predicted.  This is the first
 *    independent confirmation of round 6's rule; it holds.
 *  - Deleting `menu_base` again, all loop-2 uses direct `ItemName[...]`, on
 *    the round-6 structure (NOT a repeat of round 5 — the program changed):
 *    LENGTH 1144, same as round 5.  The result is robust, and the .s finally
 *    explains it: four `addu $reg,$sp,1424`, no hoist anywhere.
 *  - autorules on the round-6 source: 46 candidates, no improving edit.
 * Rejected in ROUND 5, each measured (see the loop-2 note above for detail):
 *  - `menu_base = ItemName` relocated below the think scan + `think_item =
 *    ItemName`: 97.  ORDER CORRECT (this is the advance), but it costs the
 *    item/category swap and 0x81c rematerialises.  Redo it only WITH a fix
 *    for those two; the shape itself is right.
 *  - FENCE_10 on that relocated statement, to restore item's lost ballast:
 *    97 (no change) — a hoisted set escapes its fence's notes.
 *  - Deleting `menu_base` entirely, all uses direct `ItemName[...]`: LENGTH
 *    1144 (-2).  The `move s0,s1` copy stops being emitted at all.
