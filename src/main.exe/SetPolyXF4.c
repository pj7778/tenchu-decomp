 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

 *  - `ply->tpage.tag`'s top byte set to 1 (setlen), and `.code[0]` packed as
 *    `((attrib & 3) << 5) | 0xE1000200` — a DR_TPAGE-style mode word (0xE1
 *    = draw-mode GPU command, with the low tpage bits ORed in).
