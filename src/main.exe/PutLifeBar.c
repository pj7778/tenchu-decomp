 * A ZERO-locals record is unverified, not a claim that the function has none:
 * vfree lists zero locals yet its byte-matched source needs seven.
 * The frame size and saved-reg mask above are the DEMO's: retail often needs
 * FEWER callee-saved registers (measured: Think1random exact; Think1chase's
 * 0x800f0000 = s0-s3+ra vs retail's s0,s1,ra). Treat them as an upper bound

/*
 * STATUS: MATCHING — pure C, all 540 bytes / 135 instructions exact.
 *
 * PutLifeBar (0x8004ab38, 0x21C bytes) — draws one life-bar "style" (style
 * 0 for the player's own bar via DoInfoViewProc, style 1 for an enemy's via
 * PutLifeBarS/ReqLifeBar): a right-to-left digit strip (identical idiom to
 * the MATCHED PutNumber.c, same TU) showing `n`, then two GsSPRITE draws —
 * a static "frame" sprite and a "fill" sprite whose height is scaled by
 * n/mx and whose color flashes red (0xE6) when low and GameClock is odd.
 *
 * The raw .s (not Ghidra's rendering, which invents wrong strides/offsets
 * for this un-named table) shows a single 0x50-byte-stride array,
 * `LifeBarStyle[2]`, NOT the 5-slot `LifeBar[]` pool (that's a different,
 * already-matched struct in ReqLifeBar.c/PutLifeBarS.c). Each entry:
 *   +0x00 u16 base   (lhu)  — height when n==0
 *   +0x02 s16 scale  (lh)   — per-unit height multiplier
 *   +0x04 s16 dx     (lh)   — digit-strip x offset from the bar position
 *   +0x06 s16 dy     (lh)   — digit-strip y offset
 *   +0x08 GsSPRITE frame    — static background/frame sprite
 *   +0x2C GsSPRITE fill     — the scaled, colored fill sprite
 * (confirmed against the sibling init function's own comment: two
 * GsSPRITE-pairs-per-style table immediately follows these same 4 header
 * shorts, `D_8008E41C`/`D_8008E440` are this file's `frame`/`fill`).
 *
 * The digit loop is a hand-rolled goto (not do/while): the /10 magic
 * constant re-materializes EVERY iteration in the target instead of being
 * hoisted to a preheader, same as PutNumber's proven rule (a real do-while
 * would get it hoisted by loop.c). `n` divides into `t`/`q` exactly like
 * PutNumber's `cols`/`q` — the remainder for NumberImage.u is `t - q*10`,
 * not Ghidra's `(char)` casts (the store to a `u8` field truncates either
 * way, so no cast is needed for the byte-truncating store to match).
 *
 * The fill sprite's `.h` field is transiently overwritten with the scaled
 * height for the GsSortSprite draw call, then restored to its old value
 * right after — the persistent per-frame `.h` is untouched across calls.
 *
 * The division `scale * n / mx` divides by the variable `mx` — needs
 * maspsx --expand-div (Build.hs maspsxGpExterns) for the break-6/break-7
 * guard sequence.
 *
 * Matching levers (none adds a target-absent instruction):
 *  - The identical `ou->r` arms use initialized `u` as their discriminator.
 *    The temporary extra `u` reference makes global allocation choose the
 *    target's $s4=u / $s5=mx ordering; testing `ou` left them swapped.
 *  - Reusing `color` first for `GameClock & 1`, then for 0xE6/0x80, gives
 *    that result a $v0 preference. A separate clock-test pseudo forced the
 *    otherwise exact color tail into $v1.
 *  - The digit quotient is a nested-block `q` whose scope ends before the
 *    backedge test. That scope boundary stops CSE from replacing the test of
 *    copied `t` ($a3) with the equivalent quotient source ($s0), resolving
 *    the final two-byte operand residual. The goto is safe: each entry
 *    assigns this scalar before use, and the block has no initializer/VLA.
