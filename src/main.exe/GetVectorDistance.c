 * GetVectorDistance (0x80039808, 0x13c bytes) — same clamp-then-scale
 * magnitude idiom as the sibling GetVectorLength.c (this TU), but takes the
 * delta between two VECTOR points instead of three raw components. See
 * GetVectorLength.c's header for the two idioms this shares:
 *  - `abs()` must be declared `long abs(long)`, not `int abs(int)` — the
 *    latter is cc1's recognized builtin and inlines to branch+negate (no
 *    `jal`) even though this build's `-fno-builtin` never reaches cc1
 *    (Build.hs only feeds it to the separate `cpp` step). The target's 3
 *    `jal 0x80076074` calls (tools/xref.py) need the non-builtin spelling.
 *  - Ghidra's `bVar1 = false; if (OR-chain) bVar1 = true; if (bVar1) ...`
 *    is literal source shape (not SSA noise): the flag surviving all three
 *    abs() calls is what puts it in a callee-saved register.
 *  - Each `if (v < 0) v = v + 0xff;` clamp is a default-then-override temp
 *    (`t = v; if (v < 0) t = v + 0xff; v = t >> 8;`), matching the target's
 *    delay-slot-filled `bgez` (the unconditional copy sits in the branch's
 *    delay slot); reassigning `v` in place compiles 8 bytes short.
