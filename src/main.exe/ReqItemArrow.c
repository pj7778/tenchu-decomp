/*
 * ReqItemArrow (0x800480c4) — spawn a homing/auto-aim arrow. Twin of
 * ReqItemDrop/ReqItemJirai/ReqItemDokudango/ReqItemLaunch (same item TU, same
 * pool round-robin on COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_ and the same
 * dispose-on-exhaustion block); like ReqItemLaunch, `it->model` is a FIXED
 * global (D_80097F4C, gp-relative in this TU like ReqItemLaunch's
 * D_80097F48) rather than D_8008E5BC[it->type], and the tail hands off to
 * SetupFly. Unlike every other twin, there's a pre-pool-search step: it
 * computes the aim direction from p->start/p->end (GetVectorRotation), packs
 * it into an SVECTOR, and feeds that to SearchItemTarget2 to find an actual
 * target position (`target`) BEFORE the round-robin allocation even starts —
 * that result becomes SetupFly's "end" vector instead of p->end directly.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - `&p->start`/`&p->end` are passed INLINE to GetVectorRotation/
 *    SearchItemTarget2 (no shared `st` temp for these two calls) — `st` only
 *    exists as the twins' usual tail-only temp (`st = &p->start;` right
 *    before the coord.t[1]/[2] reads, same statement position as every
 *    twin). Caching `&p->start` in a named variable spanning BOTH the early
 *    calls and the tail forced it into a different callee-saved register
 *    than the pool cursor/`it`, swapping $s0/$s1 vs the twins' assignment —
 *    inlining the two early address-of expressions (still CSE'd by the
 *    compiler within that straight-line prefix) reproduced the twins' exact
 *    allocation.
 *  - **Ghidra's two `short local_20[2]`/`short local_1c[2]` out-params for
 *    GetVectorRotation must be ONE combined struct/array, not two separate
 *    same-shaped locals** — declaring them as independent stack objects
 *    (whether scalar `u16`, `u16[2]`, or a padded struct) triggers EXTRA
 *    padding between them that doesn't belong (each attempt either packed
 *    them 2 bytes too tight or, once either was sized/aligned to 4 bytes,
 *    overshot by a further 4 bytes — never landing on the target's exact
 *    4-byte spacing). Declaring one `struct { u16 rx,pad0,ry,pad1; } rot;`
 *    and using `&rot.rx`/`&rot.ry` matched immediately: the pair is a single
 *    8-byte aggregate the original stack-shared for BOTH out-params, only
 *    the low half of each 4-byte slot actually read back (`lhu`, matching
 *    Ghidra's `(int *)` casts on the call — the callee likely writes a full
 *    word, the caller only needs the low 16 bits).
 *  - Same `cur`/`it` two-pseudo pool search as ReqItemLaunch (confirmed
 *    against the raw .s, not inferred): `cur = items + COUNTER...;` used
 *    throughout the loop/dispose block, `it = cur;` assigned exactly twice
 *    (the early-exit branch and right before the dispose block falls into
 *    `found:`) — the heavier tail (p/st/pp all needing registers across
 *    SetupFly) raises pressure the same way ReqItemLaunch's does.
 *  - `pp = it->param;` (plain `u8 *`, no param_korogari cast — no named
 *    field of that view is read/written here) sits BEFORE the null check,
 *    same delay-slot lever as every twin; reused unchanged for both
 *    SetupFly's 1st arg and the final `pp[0x2c] = 5;` store (unlike
 *    ReqItemLaunch's analogous store, which needed a FRESH it->param cast
 *    for its own scheduling tie — here the cached pp reproduces the target
 *    directly).
 *  - `us`/`ty` temps for owner/type, same shape as the other twins (loaded
 *    back-to-back, stored owner/proc/mode/type in that order).
 *  - GetVectorRotation's out-params are read back with `lhu` (unsigned
 *    halfword), so `rot.rx`/`rot.ry` are `u16`, not ReqItemLightningBolt's
 *    TU's `short *` — same "respell the callee's prototype per-TU" situation
 *    as ReqItemDefault's GetVectorRotation call.
 *  - `it->coll_size = 0; it->model = D_80097F4C;` immediately precede
 *    SetupFly, same position/interleaving as ReqItemLaunch.
