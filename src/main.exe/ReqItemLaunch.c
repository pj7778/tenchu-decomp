/*
 * ReqItemLaunch (0x80047738) — spawn a "launch" (catapulted/thrown-and-flying)
 * item. Twin of ReqItemDrop/ReqItemJirai/ReqItemDokudango/ReqItemKaengeki/
 * ReqItemMakibishi/ReqItemLightningBolt/ReqItemNingyo (same item TU, same
 * pool round-robin on COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_ and the same
 * dispose-on-exhaustion block); like ReqItemJirai/ReqItemDokudango there is
 * no GetAreaMapLevel floor check. It gets ProcItemLaunch as its processor.
 *
 * Unlike every other twin, `it->model` is a FIXED global (D_80097F48), not
 * D_8008E5BC[it->type]. The tail hands the flight to SetupFly (trajectory
 * from p->start to p->end) and then wires up an afterimage trail via
 * SetupAfterimage, stamping its returned struct's two SVECTOR fields and
 * recording the pointer + a trailing count byte in it->param, all at raw
 * offsets past param_korogari's proven range (0x28/0x2c/0x30) per the
 * cookbook's divergent-width-union rule — Ghidra's ".launch.effect"/
 * ".launch.count" names aren't trustworthy, only the offsets are.
 *
 * SetupFly's true arity is 6, not Ghidra's 4: Ghidra misses the two
 * STACK-passed trailing args (a common Ghidra limitation past the 4
 * register args) that m2c's raw stack-slot stores catch — the reverse
 * situation from ReqItemMakibishi's SoundEx / ReqItemNingyo's SetNowMotion,
 * where m2c instead over-counted. Always cross-check both against the raw
 * .s when they disagree; here m2c (which showed 6 params) was right.
 *
 * Matching notes (see docs/matching-cookbook.md):
 *  - Same `cur`/`it` two-pseudo pool search as ReqItemMakibishi/
 *    ReqItemLightningBolt: `cur = items + COUNTER_FOR_ITEM_ARRAY_;` in the
 *    loop/dispose block, `it = cur;` assigned once in the early-exit branch
 *    and once before the dispose block's final owner/proc zeroing (`st`
 *    surviving to the SetupFly call raises register pressure here too).
 *  - `pp = (param_korogari *)it->param;` sits BEFORE the null check, same
 *    lever as the other twins (addiu fills the beqz delay slot) — used here
 *    purely as a raw-offset cast vehicle (no named param_korogari field is
 *    read/written).
 *  - `st = &p->start;` materialized between the t[0] and t[1] stores, same
 *    as the other twins; unlike most of them, `st` is READ AGAIN as
 *    SetupFly's second argument (same "st survives to a late call" shape as
 *    ReqItemMakibishi's SoundEx(st, ...)).
 *  - us/ty are real temps, same shape as the other twins.
 *  - `it->coll_size = 0; it->model = D_80097F48;` immediately precede
 *    SetupFly, same position as the other twins' coll_size/model pair
 *    before their own end-vector tail; the scheduler interleaves these
 *    stores with SetupFly's argument setup (independent instructions).
 *  - The `it->param + 0x28 = 0` byte store is written BEFORE the
 *    SetupAfterimage call (textually) — its independence lets the scheduler
 *    drop it into the call's delay slot, same "trailing/preceding
 *    independent store steals the call's delay slot" mechanism as
 *    ReqItemNingyo's `rotate.vx = 0` before its first `rand()`. It MUST go
 *    through a fresh `it->param` cast, not `pp` (`*(u8*)((u8*)it->param +
 *    0x28)`, not `(u8*)pp + 0x28`) even though it's the same address — same
 *    "offset-0-relative-to-param routes through it, not pp" lever the other
 *    twins use for `hint = 0`. Getting the base pointer wrong here didn't
 *    change the VALUE stored, only which base register carried it ($s2/pp
 *    vs $s1/it), but that's what decided whether this store or the
 *    immediately-following `li $a1, 10` won the delay-slot scheduling tie —
 *    the wrong base left a 9-byte pure-reorder residual (same instructions,
 *    same registers, just this store one slot later) even though the
 *    function was already the right LENGTH.
 *  - `ai = SetupAfterimage(it->model, 10);` is a real temp: the pointer is
 *  - `ai = SetupAfterimage(it->model, 10);` is a real temp: the pointer is
 *    stored to it->param+0x2c AND read six more times for the vector1/
 *    vector2 fields — inlining the call would re-invoke it.
