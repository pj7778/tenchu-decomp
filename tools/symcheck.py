"""Catch auto-named data symbols that link at the wrong address.

splat names an unclaimed data symbol after its own address: `D_80097F6C` lives at
0x80097F6C. That invariant is checkable, and it breaks *silently* in one specific
way we have now hit three times:

When the LAST `INCLUDE_ASM` stub referencing such a symbol is converted to real C,
the raw asm that carried splat's auto-label disappears. splat's generated `-T`
script is processed AFTER `config/symbols.<target>.txt`, so the symbol gets rebound
to whatever address the auto-script now computes -- typically a few bytes off,
because another small object slid into the freed slot. The link SUCCEEDS. Nothing
warns. The image is simply wrong, and `matchdiff` shows a `%hi`/`%lo` or gp-offset
immediate off by a small fixed delta at every use.

The same failure appears when a sibling stub file in the same TU family lacks its
`--gp-extern` entry: maspsx synthesises a stray local placeholder and the linker
silently prefers it (the CVA family's D_80097CC0/CC4/CC8/CCA/CCC, each +4/+0xC off).

Both are caught by one rule: **a symbol named D_<HEX> must resolve to 0x<HEX>.**

    tools/symcheck.py                 # check main.exe (default)
    tools/symcheck.py --target menu.exe
    tools/symcheck.py --map path/to.map

Exits non-zero on any drift. Run it after `./Build`; it needs the linker map, which
Build.hs already emits to .shake/build/tenchu/<target>.map.

Fix a reported drift by pinning the true address in `config/symbols.<target>.txt`
(`D_80097F6C = 0x80097F6C;`) and, if the symbol is gp-relative, adding it to the
gp-extern list of EVERY sibling file in its TU -- including ones still on
INCLUDE_ASM. See docs/matching-cookbook.md, "gp vs absolute globals".
