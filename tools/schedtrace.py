"""Tabulate cc1's OWN scheduler trace: priority, ref_count, and what they mean.

**cc1 already prints this and two rounds were lost to not reading it.** The `.sched`
dump carries `;; insn[NNNN]: priority = P, ref_count = R` lines (`sched.c:3686`) —
250 of them on AddEnemy. A round hand-derived a priority from the RTL, read the
`ref_count` column as if it were priority, and concluded an insn "heads a ~7-deep
chain" and therefore sits at the ceiling. It sits at the FLOOR, cc1 said so verbatim,
and the wrong reading was then folded into the cookbook and briefed to the next round.

**The two columns are not the same metric and one is not the other's inverse:**

* `priority` is **DEPTH-FROM-TOP**. `priority()` (`sched.c:1452`) initialises
  `max_priority = 1` and raises it only by walking **LOG_LINKS** — which are
  *producers*. So an insn with `LOG_LINKS (nil)` has priority **exactly 1**,
  unconditionally, and MIPS defines no `ADJUST_PRIORITY`. Priorities that INCREASE
  as you walk DOWN a chain are depth; a height metric would run the other way.
* `ref_count` counts **consumers** (`INSN_DEPEND`). "Heads a long chain" describes
  THIS column. It is not priority and does not feed it.

So "attack the insn's height" is asking for what the code forbids: nothing can lift a
`LOG_LINKS (nil)` insn off priority 1.

It also prints cc1's `;; ready list at T-N: ... , now ...` trace — the scheduler's
actual decisions. **sched is BACKWARD: T-1 is the LAST slot and is filled FIRST, so an
insn PICKED EARLIER LANDS LATER.** FUN_80057b80's entire 8-byte residual is one such
line:

    ;; ready list at T-20: 6 (1) 4 (1), now 6 4     -> picks 6, so 6 lands last

  tools/schedtrace.py <Name>                the sched1 trace, in dump order
  tools/schedtrace.py <Name> --pass sched2  the post-reload scheduler
  tools/schedtrace.py <Name> --sort         ordered by priority, floor first
  tools/schedtrace.py <Name> --floor        only the priority-1 insns (the ties)

**A PROLOGUE or PARM-COPY ordering question lives ONLY in `--pass sched2`.** The
prologue does not exist until after reload, so parm copies never enter sched1's table
at all. This tool was sched1-only and a lane hand-decoded the raw `.i.sched2` instead
— it called that the single biggest cost of its round.
