"""Tabulate cc1's OWN scheduler trace: priority, ref_count, and what they mean.

**cc1 already prints this and two rounds were lost to not reading it.** The `.sched`
dump carries `;; insn[NNNN]: priority = P, ref_count = R` lines (`sched.c:3686`) —
250 of them on AddEnemy. A round hand-derived a priority from the RTL, read the
`ref_count` column as if it were priority, and concluded an insn "heads a ~7-deep
chain" and therefore sits at the ceiling. It sits at the FLOOR, cc1 said so verbatim,
and the wrong reading was then folded into the cookbook and briefed to the next round.

**The two columns are not the same metric and one is not the other's inverse:**

* `priority` is NOT depth, and **a flat column of 1 means UNIT LATENCY, not "no
  producers"**. `priority()` (`sched.c:1452`) accumulates
  `priority(x) + insn_cost(x, prev, insn) - 1` over **LOG_LINKS** (producers). gcc's
  own comment on that `- 1` says it outright: *"When all instructions have a latency
  of 1 ... Subtracting one here ensures that in such cases all instructions will end
  up with a priority of one, and hence no scheduling will be done."* So on a
  unit-latency machine a whole dependence chain floors at 1. **An insn printing
  priority 1 while DEPENDING on another priority-1 insn is correct, not a bug** — and
  "priority 1 ⟹ it has no producers" is a false inference that has cost real rounds.
* `ref_count` counts **consumers** (`INSN_DEPEND`). "Heads a long chain" describes
  THIS column. It is not priority and does not feed it.

**Priority 1 is not a floor you are stuck on.** This tool used to assert "nothing can
lift a `LOG_LINKS (nil)` insn off priority 1, and MIPS defines no `ADJUST_PRIORITY`".
The macro claim is true (0 hits in `config/mips/mips.h`) and **irrelevant** — the bump
lives in the FUNCTION `adjust_priority` (`sched.c:2535`), not the macro, so the macro's
absence disables nothing. The inference was false and it misled a whole round.

**What `adjust_priority` actually does, in this compiler: exactly one thing.** It is
gated on `reload_completed == 0` (**sched1 only, never sched2**) and switches on
`n_deaths` — but gcc's own comment there reads *"??? This code has no effect, because
REG_DEAD notes are removed before we ever get here."* So `n_deaths` is always 0, the
`default:`/`3`/`2`/`1` shift-down arms are DEAD, and only `case 0` runs: if
`birthing_insn_p(PATTERN(prev))`, set `INSN_PRIORITY(prev) = max_priority`. And
`max_priority` (`sched.c:2605`) is `MAX(INSN_PRIORITY(ready[0]), INSN_PRIORITY(insn))`
where `insn` was set to `LAUNCH_PRIORITY` (0x7f000001) at `sched.c:3923` immediately
before the `schedule_insn` call — **which is why a bumped birthing insn shows up as
`(7f000001)` in a later ready list.** `birthing_insn_p` (2499) fires iff the pattern is
`(set (REG) ...)` with a live dest and **`REG_N_SETS == 1`**.

**Anatomy of a `ready list` line — verified against the source, not inferred:**

    ;; ready list at T-20: 6 (1) 4 (1), now 6 4
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^
                           UNSORTED,         SORTED (after SCHED_SORT)
                           priorities in HEX

`sched.c:3756` prints `UID (INSN_PRIORITY in hex)` for each ready insn **before**
`SCHED_SORT`; `sched.c:3793` prints the UIDs again **after** the sort, and
`last_scheduled_insn = insn = ready[0]` — **so the first UID after `now` IS THE PICK.**
Because the print precedes this iteration's `LAUNCH_PRIORITY` store, a `(7f000001)` in
the printed list is a *durable* birthing bump from an earlier iteration, not the
transient marker.

**`rank_for_schedule` ties break priority DESC → class DESC → LUID DESC**, and **class
is a CEILING, not a lever.** An insn `link == 0` (independent of `last_scheduled_insn`)
*or* with `insn_cost == 1` gets class **3** — the maximum — unconditionally; only a
dependence with cost ≠ 1 drops you to class 1 (data) or 2 (anti/output). Since the sort
is descending, **perturbing a dependence's cost can only sort the DEPENDENT insn LATER.
Never propose "change the dep cost" as a lever to promote a dependent insn** (that
"open lever" was proposed once, and it was backwards).

It also prints cc1's `;; ready list at T-N: ... , now ...` trace — the scheduler's
actual decisions. **sched is BACKWARD: T-1 is the LAST slot and is filled FIRST, so an
insn PICKED EARLIER LANDS LATER.** FUN_80057b80's entire 8-byte residual is one such
line:

    ;; ready list at T-20: 6 (1) 4 (1), now 6 4     -> picks 6, so 6 lands last

  tools/schedtrace.py <Name>                the sched1 trace, in dump order
  tools/schedtrace.py <Name> --pass sched2  the post-reload scheduler
  tools/schedtrace.py <Name> --sort         ordered by priority, floor first
  tools/schedtrace.py <Name> --floor        only the priority-1 insns (the ties)

**A PROLOGUE or PARM-COPY ordering question lives ONLY in `--pass sched2`.** The
prologue does not exist until after reload, so parm copies never enter sched1's table
at all. This tool was sched1-only and a lane hand-decoded the raw `.i.sched2` instead
— it called that the single biggest cost of its round.
