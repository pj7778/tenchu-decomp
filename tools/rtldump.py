"""Dump the build-profile cc1's RTL passes for ONE function, standalone and race-free.

This is the escalation tool for a same-length register/coloring/scheduling residual
that no C respelling and no permuter run has closed. Nine such "permuter-immune,
below-the-C-level" parks fell this session by READING these dumps instead of
guessing — every one turned out to be reachable source structure. See
docs/matching-cookbook.md, "Reading cc1's RTL dumps (the escalation method)".

It compiles `src/main.exe/<Name>.c` exactly the way `./Build` does (same cpp
defines, same per-original-object cc1 executable and flags), but standalone in
the scratchpad — no Shake, no `.shake/` database, so it never races a concurrent
build. It requests the RTL dump passes and leaves them next to the `.s` for you
to read.

    tools/rtldump.py <Name>                 # default passes: greg, lreg, jump, combine
    tools/rtldump.py <Name> --pass all      # -da: every pass (loop, cse, flow, sched, reorg…)
    tools/rtldump.py <Name> --pass loop     # just loop.c (invariant hoisting: the .loop dump)
    tools/rtldump.py <Name> --pass greg,lreg,reorg,sched
    tools/rtldump.py <Name> --draft         # REQUIRED for a guarded C draft
    tools/rtldump.py <Name> --lines         # + source-line-mapped object/disassembly

The dumps land in <scratchpad>/rtl/<Name>/ ; the tool prints the paths and a legend.

Reading them (short version — the doc has the worked mechanics):
  .greg  (-dg, global-alloc)  allocno priorities, `N conflicts: …`, `N preferences: H`,
                              and `Register dispositions: N in H` (pseudo N -> hard H).
                              Two roles in one hard reg = one variable; one value in
                              two hard regs = two variables (2.8.1 never splits a range).
  .lreg  (-dl, local-alloc)   local (per-block) allocation before global.
  .loop  (-dL, loop opt)      invariant hoisting decisions as a threshold economy
                              (`Insn N: regno R (life L), savings S moved / not desirable`).
  .jump2 (-dj, jump opt)      cross-jump / return-insn / delay-branch decisions.
  .combine (-dc)              instruction combining (where an addu/subu operand order
                              or a fold reassociation gets decided).
  .sched2/.dbr (-dR/-dd)      scheduling + delay-slot (reorg) fills.

Hard register numbers: 0 zero, 1 at, 2 v0, 3 v1, 4-7 a0-a3, 8-15 t0-t7, 16-23 s0-s7,
24-25 t8-t9, 28 gp, 29 sp, 30 fp/s8, 31 ra.

# Key the dump directory to THIS worktree, at a STABLE path.
#
# Two failures shaped this, in order:
#  1. The original default was a bare shared `<tmp>/tenchu-rtldump`, so every
#     concurrent agent wrote dumps for the same function name to one path and a
#     lane was nearly misled by a sibling's stale `.greg`. Hence the ROOT hash.
#  2. The fix then used `tempfile.gettempdir()`, which reads TMPDIR — and
#     `nix develop` mints a FRESH TMPDIR PER INVOCATION. So the path changed on
#     every run: a lane captured one, reused it next call, silently diffed two
#     EMPTY files and got a clean "IDENTICAL" — a false measurement, which is
#     the exact class this tool exists to prevent. Hence the fixed base.
#
# `/tmp` rather than gettempdir(): it must be stable ACROSS invocations for a
# two-variant RTL comparison to be possible at all, and every nix-shell tmpdir
# lives under it anyway. CLAUDE_SCRATCH still overrides.
#  3. The ROOT hash was then applied only when CLAUDE_SCRATCH was UNSET -- and
#     agents ALWAYS have it set, pointing at the SHARED scratchpad. So the
#     isolation never applied in the one situation it existed for: a lane found
#     two OTHER lanes' stale `mission_score_screen.i.sched` dumps there and said a
#     smaller model would have read one as its own. The hash is now appended
#     UNCONDITIONALLY -- CLAUDE_SCRATCH chooses the location, never the isolation.

    This is the reusable backend for rtldump.py, regalloc/guide-style tools,

    participate in the real build, but causes source NOTE objects to survive in
    every RTL pass.  `assemble` additionally runs the exact maspsx/as pipeline
    and writes an objdump whose instructions retain their originating C line.

    **`-g` RENUMBERS EVERY UID.** Its extra NOTE objects consume UIDs, so a UID
    read from a `debug_lines=True` dump does NOT name the same insn as the same
    number in a normal dump -- on FUN_80057b80 every UID shifts by 45 (insn 1998
    becomes 2043).  The emitted instruction SEQUENCE is unchanged (verified: the
    `-dp` pattern sequence is identical with and without `-g`), so the honest
    bridge between the two compiles is the instruction INDEX, never the UID.
    sched-deps.py does exactly that, and guards it by comparing the two pattern
    sequences.

    `extra_flags` are appended to cc1's command line.  `-dp` is the intended
    use: it makes cc1 annotate the FIRST asm insn of each RTL insn with
    `# <uid> <pattern>` (final.c:2549), which is cc1's own UID -> asm mapping and
    the only non-hand-rolled bridge from a dump UID to an emitted instruction.
