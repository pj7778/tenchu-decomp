"""Turn an assembly residual plus our RTL into a mechanical next action.

The target executable has no RTL.  Its assembly is the specification; our
compiler's RTL is the causal trace.  rtlguide aligns the target and candidate
instructions, classifies each residual by the cc1 pass that owns it, recompiles
the candidate with debug NOTE objects, and maps the mismatching instructions
back to concrete C lines and final hard-register locals.

This replaces the usual manual loop of `asmdiff -> guess a pass -> rtldump ->
grep source lines -> regalloc` with one reproducible report.  The report is also
consumed by `autorules.py --guided`, which restricts its search to the relevant
cookbook transformations and can try byte-neutral pure-C enabling edits with a
beam.  It also calls out target-only physical calls and summarizes the
candidate's CALL_INSN result/argument fingerprints: jump2 can distinguish calls
whose final machine instructions look identical.

    tools/rtlguide.py <Name>              build draft + full guided report
    tools/rtlguide.py <Name> --no-build   reuse the current .shake build

Run inside the nix devShell.  The RTL/debug compilation is standalone under
