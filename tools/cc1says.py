"""Everything cc1 SAYS about its own decisions — every self-reporting table, one call.

cc1 narrates its work in `;;` commentary across all 15 `-da` dumps. **We were reading
about three of those tables and hand-deriving the rest.** Every time a lane
hand-derived something cc1 prints, it cost a round, and twice it produced a confident
WRONG conclusion:

* `.sched`'s `priority`/`ref_count` table (250 lines): a round read the `ref_count`
  column as priority, concluded an insn "heads a 7-deep chain" and sits at the ceiling
  when it sits at the FLOOR, and INVERTED a correct 6-round-old park. The 7 belonged to
  a different insn two lines away.
* `.sched2`'s ready list: FUN_80057b80's entire 8-byte residual is ONE line
  (`ready list at T-20: 6 (1) 4 (1), now 6 4`). A lane hand-decoded the raw dump and
  called it the single biggest cost of its round.
* `.loop`'s movable log: SetBleedsDir's whole 13-byte residual was one line
  (`moved to 388` vs a matched sibling's `not desirable`). A lane called it "the single
  highest-value artifact here" and found it only by reading the raw dump.

And these were surfaced by NOTHING until this tool — despite rounds spent on each:
* **`.dbr`'s delay-slot histogram** — `12 insns needing delay slots / 4 got 0 delays,
  8 got 1 delays`. FOUR delay-slot rounds ran blind to cc1's own fill count.
* **`.cse`'s block boundaries** — `Processing block from 2 to 76, 29 sets`. We reason
  about "cse's block ends at every CODE_LABEL" constantly and hand-derive where.
* **`.combine`'s success count** — `138 attempts, 101 substitutions, 17 successes`.
  The direct answer to "did my combine fire?".
* **`Registers live:` per block** (`.flow`/`.lreg`/`.combine`/`.jump2`) — the register
  pressure at each point, printed outright.

  tools/cc1says.py <Name>              every table, every pass
  tools/cc1says.py <Name> --pass loop  just one pass
  tools/cc1says.py <Name> --full       do not cap bulk tables (see below)
  tools/cc1says.py <Name> --raw        also dump the `;;` lines we do not interpret yet

Bulk tables are capped so sched's 250-row priority list cannot drown the rare, valuable
lines — but a cap must always leave a route to the rest. It did not: it showed 6 of
`.lreg`'s 46 rows and named no way through, and a lane hand-correlated the raw dump to
answer "does this LOCAL-ONLY pseudo have a conflicting sibling in its own block?".
The suppression notice now prints the count, `--full`, and the raw dump's path.

Compare two functions (e.g. a draft against its matched sibling) by running it on each:
identical movables with opposite verdicts, or differing delay-slot fill counts, are
usually the whole residual.
