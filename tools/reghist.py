"""Register-mention histogram: target vs our build, per register.

The recommended FIRST move on any big Ghidra-derived function. Three lanes
hand-rolled this with ad-hoc greps before it became a tool; it answers two
questions in one second that otherwise cost a round each:

* **Is there a mega-pseudo?** Ghidra reuses one variable for a dozen unrelated
  jobs. Each C local is ONE pseudo and one pseudo gets ONE hard register for ALL
  its fragments, so a conflict anywhere exiles every use. A caller-saved register
  the DRAFT mentions far more than the target is that tell — splitting the
  variable per site was worth 140 bytes on FUN_80057b80 (`iVar3`: 70 mentions vs
  the target's 5).
* **Are the OPCODES even the same?** A register histogram is blind to `lh` vs
  `lhu`: a wrong mnemonic shows an identical register profile and would read as
  "pure renames", when it is a structural defect no allocation steering can fix
  (ControlHumanoid's 17-byte park was exactly that). This tool checks the
  mnemonic histogram first and says so loudly.
* **Is the decomposition already exhausted?** Read the delta SUM. Deltas that sum
  to ZERO and sit only in the argument registers are the signature of pure
  renames of identical instructions: no splitting lever remains, and the residual
  is allocation/scheduling (StageEndScreen: s0-s8 and v0 exact, args +5/+3/+2/-4/-6,
  sum 0). A non-zero sum means real structural divergence — go find it.

Also useful: a register the target mentions N times has N-2 body refs (the
prologue `sw` and epilogue `lw` are the other two), which is the cheapest
possible check on any "the original's X carries K refs" claim.

  tools/reghist.py <Name>          histogram, differences first (builds the
                                   DRAFT itself for a guarded function)
  tools/reghist.py <Name> --all    every register, including the equal ones
  tools/reghist.py <Name> -n       skip ./Build (reads the image on disk)

The candidate extent comes from the link map, so a stale Ghidra size cannot
truncate the view. Run inside the nix devShell.
