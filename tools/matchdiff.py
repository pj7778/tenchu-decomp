"""Byte-compare one function between our build and the original main.exe.

The core loop of matching work (docs/matching-cookbook.md): edit the C, run
this, watch the differing-byte count drop, read the per-instruction diff to
see what the compiler did differently. Run inside the nix devShell.

Usage:
  tools/matchdiff.py ProcItemKusuri            # ./Build first, then compare
  tools/matchdiff.py ProcItemKusuri -n         # skip the build (reuse last)
  tools/matchdiff.py ProcItemKusuri --max 60   # show up to 60 differing insns

The function's address comes from config/symbols.main.exe.txt; its size is the
distance to the next symbol (same slot logic as mkmod). Exit status: 0 on a
byte-match, 1 otherwise — usable as a gate in scripts.

This tool is the byte GATE and aligns by ADDRESS. That makes it the authority on
"how many bytes differ" and a poor witness for "what moved": a pure displacement
renders as a clean one-slot shift, and an adjacent swap can sit inside a region
this reports as identical (FUN_8003944c's `sh 24`/`sh 26` swap hid exactly there,
and the lane found it only by dumping the raw target `.s`). For ORDER questions use
`tools/asmdiff.py`, which aligns by CONTENT and flags MOVED instructions.
