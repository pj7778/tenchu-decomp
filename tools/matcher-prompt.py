"""Generate a matcher-agent launch prompt for a function.

The orchestrator shouldn't hand-write agent instructions from scratch each time.
This emits a complete, ready-to-launch prompt with the per-function facts
auto-derived (address/size, jump-table-or-not, nearest matched worked examples,
TU family, gp reminder) wired into a stable template. The evolving cross-cutting
guidance lives in GUIDANCE below (and, in depth, in docs/matching-cookbook.md +
.claude/agents/matcher.md) — update it here as we learn, so every future launch
inherits the lesson.

    "else is an automatic matchdiff blocker; never use it to force bytes.",
    "If this function still has a FUN_ or hand-written descriptive name and "
    "the original demo name becomes genuinely converged, report/adopt it "
    "instead of leaving the custom label: first prove the demo name is unused "
    "in the current retail inventory, callmatch --verify is non-ambiguous (or "
    "a byte-matched callback setter supplies identity), and prototype, constants, "
    "behavior, and surrounding source allocation agree. Keep the exact-C match "
    "and the rename as separate commits. A candidates.tsv row alone is never "
    "enough.",

    "`./Build check` is the ONLY gate. matchdiff's window can be shorter than "
    "the function (and for a split function covers only piece 1 — use asmdiff). "
    "Removing the INCLUDE_ASM is not evidence of a match; never report MATCH "
    "without a green `./Build clean && ./Build check`.",

    "The permuter is worth ONE bounded FOREGROUND run (`timeout 300 "
    "tools/permute.py <Name> -- --stop-on-zero -j4`; never background it, never "
    "Monitor-wait it) whenever autorules finds nothing and the residual is the "
    "SAME LENGTH. But do NOT park a same-length residual just because the permuter "
    "fails — that is the signal to READ THE RTL. Run `tools/rtldump.py <Name>` and "

    "nine \"permuter-immune\" ties fell this way (register-coalescing, guard "
    "delay-slot, %hi-reload, loop.c hoist — all previously listed as un-permutable) "
    "and every one was reachable source structure named in the dumps. Only a GTE "
    "COMMAND opcode (mvmva/rtps in the .s) is truly un-matchable in this cc1 — park "
    "that on sight.",

    "A bare `lui $rN,0xHHHH` with NO `addiu`, reused as a base across several "
    "accesses, means the source held the address in a LOCAL via a literal "
    "pointer cast — `(PersistentState *)0x80010000`, not `extern u8 D_80010047`. "
    "The extern form lets cc1 fold the address into each memory operand, so `as` "
    "re-materialises `%hi` per use through `$at`: extra `lui`s and WRONG LENGTH.",

    "For a stock PsyQ library leaf, do not assume the game's cc1 address-splitting "
    "default. If the original SDK object proves one unsplit `la` feeding multiple "
    "offset-0 accesses, use a narrowly scoped Build.hs `ccExtraFlags` entry such as "
    "`-mno-split-addresses`, and mirror it in permute.py's `CC_EXTRA_FLAGS`. Confirm "
    "the provenance and run check-all before accepting a per-TU flag (MemCardCallback).",

    "If the link fails with `undefined reference to D_XXXXXXXX`, splat only "
    "auto-labels data that still-carved *asm* references — matching the last "
    "such function drops the symbol. Add a plain `D_XXXXXXXX = 0xXXXXXXXX;` to "
    "config/symbols.main.exe.txt (that file has NO comment syntax).",

    "A 3-instruction `sll 16 / sra k / sra 16-k` (k!=16) is the blocked GetPad "
    "sign-extension class — park it. The ordinary 2-instruction `sll 16 / sra K` "
    "is just a short-indexed array's fused extend+scale and matches fine.",

    "Before trusting the Ghidra export's SIZE, remember two entries are "
    "under-sized (LoadCard, FUN_800593a0) and a truncated carve still builds "
    "GREEN — run `tools/coverage.py` if a function's body seems to run past its "
    "carve, and re-carve with `reverse.py <Name> --size 0x<true>`.",

    "Ghidra's SCALAR types are gold, but its inferred STRUCT NAMES are often "

    "NEITHER Ghidra nor m2c discloses access WIDTH. For struct layout trust "

    "Ghidra's struct name; reach a divergent-width union field via an offset "
    "cast off the same proven pointer (`*(s32 *)((u8 *)pp + 0xC) = 0;`).",

    "*local* cookbook rules — every local's integer type (s16<->s32 index/call-"
    "result, sign toggles), splitting/merging `&&` chains, inlining single-use "
    "temps — and greedily keeps what shrinks the asmdiff, reporting which edit "
    "helped (`n: s16->s32: 4->0`). It's the deterministic first pass — if it "
    "reports no win, the residual is NOT one of those mechanical rules (don't "
    "keep guessing them; it's structure/regalloc — read the diff or permute). "
    "Type-width deliberately refuses signed->unsigned candidates when the local "
    "is explicitly sign-tested or arithmetically right-shifted: a better partial "
    "score cannot justify deleting a negative correction or changing sra to srl.",
    "If a returning guard's branch delay slot contains the fallthrough's first "
    "arithmetic producer, keep that producer AFTER the returning `if`; hoisting "

    "wrong later instruction instead (death_camera_something_).",
    "When an inlined endian/byte-pack helper's target loads use two already-live "
    "cursor registers, pass both cursor identities to the helper and load each "
    "byte through its target base. This can preserve both inline pseudos and an "
    "address-taken output store (AfsGetEntry); require the raw asm load bases.",
    "If the target freshly reloads an extern pointer-array slot before a field "
    "read even though cc1 can CSE the earlier pointer, use a site-local volatile "
    "view of the SLOT: `(*(T *volatile *)&Array[i])->field`. Do not make `T` or "
    "the shared extern globally volatile; require the target's reload+nop evidence "
    "(UpdateEvent). If an index-first integer pointer sum still interleaves its "
    "narrow sll/sra with `%hi/%lo`, name the scaled byte offset in an s32 statement "
    "before the sum.",
    "If a single-use stack parameter is load-sunk but the target reads it once at "
    "entry and keeps the value across calls, an ordinary local copy may collapse. "
    "Qualify the parameter object and copy it once instead: `volatile int mode`, "
    "then `saved = mode` and use only `saved`. Top-level parameter qualifiers are "
    "ABI-compatible; require the target's one early load (CdaPlayXA).",
    "For a pure REGISTER tie (right length, right instructions, a value in the "
    "wrong register — and autorules found nothing + a short permuter run won't "
    "beat the base), don't blind-permute: run `tools/regalloc.py <Name>`. It runs "
    "cc1 -dg and shows which values are live across calls (forced callee-saved), "
    "the pseudo->hard-reg map, and the copy-chains that bias the coloring — so you "
    "break the specific copy-chain / shorten the live range it names instead of "
    "guessing. (This is a genuine sub-C tie class; cap effort and NON_MATCHING it "
    "if regalloc.py shows the target's register is unreachable from C.)",
    "If an indexed table loop and a pointer cursor have the same final induction "
    "instructions but the preheader addresses are scheduled in the wrong order, "
    "try `T[index]` with an `s32` index. loop.c can eliminate that BIV and create "
    "the strength-reduced pointer GIV later, changing its RTL UID/order without "
    "changing the loop body. Require `.loop` BIV/GIV evidence and `.sched2` "
    "confirmation (check_for_known_button_combination).",
    "N loads adjacent with no use between them are source temps (us/ty), even if "
    "the scheduler later scatters their stores.",
    "Before inventing a `D_XXXXXXXX` name or an anonymous struct layout for an "
    "unknown global, look it up in the Ghidra export: `.shake/ghidra-export/"
    "types.h` (by struct tag) and `symbols.tsv`/`functions.tsv` (by address). "
    "Ghidra often has the fully-named ORIGINAL struct/symbol (e.g. PadArrange, "

    "offsets — use the real name/layout and add a plain `NAME = 0xADDR;` to "
    "config/symbols if it isn't auto-named.",
    "When Ghidra's union rendering has MORE assignment lines than access.py's "
    "per-register offset count, check the m2c reference's raw-offset dump "
