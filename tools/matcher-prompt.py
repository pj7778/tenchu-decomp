"""Generate a matcher-agent launch prompt for a function.

The orchestrator shouldn't hand-write agent instructions from scratch each time.
This emits a complete, ready-to-launch prompt with the per-function facts
auto-derived (address/size, jump-table-or-not, nearest matched worked examples,
TU family, gp reminder) wired into a stable template. The evolving cross-cutting
guidance lives in GUIDANCE below (and, in depth, in docs/matching-cookbook.md +
.claude/agents/matcher.md) — update it here as we learn, so every future launch
inherits the lesson.

  tools/matcher-prompt.py <Name>            print the prompt
  tools/matcher-prompt.py <Name> --model sonnet   (annotate suggested model)

Run inside the nix devShell (uses findsimilar for the nearest examples).

    "`./Build check` is the ONLY gate. matchdiff's window can be shorter than "
    "the function (and for a split function covers only piece 1 — use asmdiff). "
    "Removing the INCLUDE_ASM is not evidence of a match; never report MATCH "
    "without a green `./Build clean && ./Build check`.",

    "The permuter is worth ONE bounded run whenever autorules finds nothing and "
    "the residual is the SAME LENGTH as the target — it has cracked 5-byte "
    "register ties, a 61-byte schedule/colour miss, and a pure statement-order "
    "fix (one field store one line earlier than its offset-order position). Only "
    "two residual classes are known permuter-immune, and you must NOT permute "
    "them: the `la`/address-materialization reload tie (`%hi` in a temp vs the "
    "target register), and the guard delay-slot fill tie (branch's own `move "
    "$v0,zero` vs the fallthrough's data-independent `lui`). Park those at once.",

    "A bare `lui $rN,0xHHHH` with NO `addiu`, reused as a base across several "
    "accesses, means the source held the address in a LOCAL via a literal "
    "pointer cast — `(PersistentState *)0x80010000`, not `extern u8 D_80010047`. "
    "The extern form lets cc1 fold the address into each memory operand, so `as` "
    "re-materialises `%hi` per use through `$at`: extra `lui`s and WRONG LENGTH.",

    "If the link fails with `undefined reference to D_XXXXXXXX`, splat only "
    "auto-labels data that still-carved *asm* references — matching the last "
    "such function drops the symbol. Add a plain `D_XXXXXXXX = 0xXXXXXXXX;` to "
    "config/symbols.main.exe.txt (that file has NO comment syntax).",

    "A 3-instruction `sll 16 / sra k / sra 16-k` (k!=16) is the blocked GetPad "
    "sign-extension class — park it. The ordinary 2-instruction `sll 16 / sra K` "
    "is just a short-indexed array's fused extend+scale and matches fine.",

    "Before trusting the Ghidra export's SIZE, remember two entries are "
    "under-sized (LoadCard, FUN_800593a0) and a truncated carve still builds "
    "GREEN — run `tools/coverage.py` if a function's body seems to run past its "
    "carve, and re-carve with `reverse.py <Name> --size 0x<true>`.",

    "Ghidra's SCALAR types are gold, but its inferred STRUCT NAMES are often "
    "wrong (it invents PARAM_ITEM_DROP etc. with fields shifted 4 bytes) and "
    "NEITHER Ghidra nor m2c discloses access WIDTH. For struct layout trust "
    "item.h's proven view + `tools/access.py` (offset -> sw/sh/sb width) over "
    "Ghidra's struct name; reach a divergent-width union field via an offset "
    "cast off the same proven pointer (`*(s32 *)((u8 *)pp + 0xC) = 0;`).",
    "Lean on the tools; don't re-derive their output by hand. gpsyms --write "
    "syncs the gp lists, xref gives the prototype/externs, reverse.py seeds both "
    "a Ghidra AND an m2c reference (m2c = cleaner control flow / register temps, "
    "Ghidra = types/names).",
    "Once your draft COMPILES (set NON_MATCHING for a partial), run "
    "`tools/autorules.py <Name>` BEFORE hand-tuning: it mechanically sweeps the "
    "*local* cookbook rules — every local's integer type (s16<->s32 index/call-"
    "result, sign toggles), splitting/merging `&&` chains, inlining single-use "
    "temps — and greedily keeps what shrinks the asmdiff, reporting which edit "
    "helped (`n: s16->s32: 4->0`). It's the deterministic first pass — if it "
    "reports no win, the residual is NOT one of those mechanical rules (don't "
    "keep guessing them; it's structure/regalloc — read the diff or permute).",
    "For a pure REGISTER tie (right length, right instructions, a value in the "
    "wrong register — and autorules found nothing + a short permuter run won't "
    "beat the base), don't blind-permute: run `tools/regalloc.py <Name>`. It runs "
    "cc1 -dg and shows which values are live across calls (forced callee-saved), "
    "the pseudo->hard-reg map, and the copy-chains that bias the coloring — so you "
    "break the specific copy-chain / shorten the live range it names instead of "
    "guessing. (This is a genuine sub-C tie class; cap effort and NON_MATCHING it "
    "if regalloc.py shows the target's register is unreachable from C.)",
    "N loads adjacent with no use between them are source temps (us/ty), even if "
    "the scheduler later scatters their stores.",
    "Before inventing a `D_XXXXXXXX` name or an anonymous struct layout for an "
    "unknown global, look it up in the Ghidra export: `.shake/ghidra-export/"
    "types.h` (by struct tag) and `symbols.tsv`/`functions.tsv` (by address). "
    "Ghidra often has the fully-named ORIGINAL struct/symbol (e.g. PadArrange, "
    "TCdaStatus) even when the calling function's own decompilation showed only "
    "offsets — use the real name/layout and add a plain `NAME = 0xADDR;` to "
    "config/symbols if it isn't auto-named.",
    "When Ghidra's union rendering has MORE assignment lines than access.py's "
    "per-register offset count, check the m2c reference's raw-offset dump "
    "(already in the seed) BEFORE opening the raw .s — it usually disambiguates "
