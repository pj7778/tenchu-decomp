"""Mechanically apply the cookbook's *local* matching rules and keep what helps.

Most cookbook rules are RECOGNITION rules: you must read the asm diff to know
which one applies and where (loop shape, switch-vs-ladder, union-offset casts,
two-regs-same-value...). A blind sweep can't place those. But a handful are
purely MECHANICAL — a token/expression rewrite at an enumerable site whose only
open question is "does it move the bytes the right way?". Nobody (agent or human)
should hand-apply those every time.

This tool enumerates every applicable site of each mechanical rule, tries it,
rebuilds, and rescores with the authoritative whole-image byte diff — then
GREEDILY keeps the single best improving edit and repeats until nothing helps
(or it MATCHES). Greedy re-sweeping handles independent wins. Guided mode adds
a bounded beam, because a pure-C CFG or loop-note edit can be byte-neutral by
itself but enable the next edit.

It is the deterministic, explainable first pass that complements decomp-permuter
(the stochastic search over register-allocation ties): autorules reports exactly
which rule closed how many instructions ("widen `n` to s32: -16"), leaving a
smaller residual for a permuter run or an agent's judgment.

Safe by construction: byte-identical to the original IS correctness, so a full
MATCH is always valid; any non-zero result is advisory and gets reviewed. A
semantically-wrong rewrite simply fails to improve the score and is discarded.

Run inside the nix devShell. Each candidate costs one ./Build (incremental), so
a run is a few dozen builds — a minute or two, unattended.

Candidate output is line-buffered for monitors. Matching tools share one
per-worktree lock. Candidates compile from a private staged source, so even an
ungraceful exit cannot strand a speculative rewrite in the checked-in file.
SIGTERM/SIGHUP also tear down the active build process group, and on Linux a
parent-death signal prevents a command frontend from orphaning autorules.
