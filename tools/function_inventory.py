"""Load retail function boundaries with the repository's current names.

Ghidra's ``functions.tsv`` remains the authoritative boundary/size inventory,
but it is a snapshot: adopting a name in the decomp does not rewrite that
export.  The named ``c`` subsegments in splat's current config are the
authoritative source/object names.  Overlay those names by address so symbol
recovery does not treat already-renamed functions as placeholders or lose
their names when resolving callees.
