This is a decompilation project for the PS1 game Tenchu. There are various tools
in here. The final goal is probably to implement a byte-identical
reimplementation of the game, not unlike was done for Mario 64 etc.

Read the current plan from PLAN.md . You can update this file with TODOs and
future tasks as well as mark things already done etc. The developer docs index
is docs/README.md — read it before non-trivial work; it explains the build,
toolchain decisions, modding, ISO/emulator flow, and the Ghidra bridge.

Record durable knowledge — build/env gotchas, toolchain decisions, reusable
lessons, tool facts — in the relevant `docs/` file (the shared repo), NOT in
private agent memory, so humans and agents on other machines benefit too.
Private memory is only for thin cross-session pointers back to these docs.

For byte-matching new functions (the core activity), follow
docs/matching-cookbook.md: it records the cc1 2.8.1 source idioms that
reproduce the original bytes (dispatch/loop/expression/stack/regalloc rules,
all verified), and the workflow — tools/reverse.py to split a function, then
iterate with tools/matchdiff.py <Name> until MATCH, then ./Build check.
Keep the cookbook updated: when matching teaches a new reusable rule, add it
there (not just to session memory), and extend the worked-example pointers.
Pick targets with tools/findsimilar.py --targets (unmatched functions ranked
by similarity to already-matched ones). For batch matching, follow docs/orchestration.md (the runbook: tool map,
launch/harvest procedure, model routing, bundling economics, the reflection
loop). In short: generate the launch prompt with tools/matcher-prompt.py
<Name> (auto-derives facts + carries the evolving guidance) and spawn the
`matcher` agent (.claude/agents/matcher.md), one function each;
the main session reviews, commits only on green `./Build check`, and folds
newly reported rules into the cookbook.

If you need some tools, you can use ~/programming/nixpkgs to get anything you
need from nix.

Commit authorship: each agent commits under its own identity — Claude commits
as Claude (`git -c user.name="Claude Fable 5" -c user.email="noreply@anthropic.com"
commit …`; the repo-level git config identity belongs to Codex and must not be
changed), and Codex commits as Codex. Matcher-agent worktrees inherit the repo
config, so when harvesting an agent commit, fix the author at cherry-pick time
(`git commit --amend --no-edit --author="Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"`).
