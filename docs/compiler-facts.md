# Verified cc1 2.8.1 mechanics — the audit substrate

Facts about the pinned compiler, each verified against the gcc-2.8.1 sources on
disk and/or measured on a named function. This file exists so an agent can
**audit a tool's verdict**: when `regalloc`/`schedtrace`/`rtlguide` prints a
claim, these are the mechanics it rests on. It is NOT assigned reading — grep it.

Rules of evidence: a mechanism claim is worth exactly as much as the source line
it cites. `tools/ccsrc.py` surfaces the pinned gcc tree (an unpacked directory
despite its name: `/nix/store/117i80brbgcdmcl46gmpzwizikbjyx5m-gcc-2.8.1.tar.gz/`).
Two lanes have "remembered" gcc code that does not exist (a cost comparison in
`reload_cse_simplify_set`; `rare_destination` returning 1) — open the file.

## Front end / trees

- **Enum struct fields are 4 bytes** (no `-fshort-enums`) — a raw enum-typedef
  field silently shifts every later field; repo convention is
  `u16 name; // enum X` (character_state). An enum-typed dispatch parameter
  with all-non-negative enumerators compares UNSIGNED (`sltiu`), a plain `s32`
  gives `slti` (ProcMiscSprite/ProcMiscFire).
- **`convert_to_integer` narrows `NEGATE_EXPR` through a truncation** (convert.c),
  so `narrow = -narrowVar` can never sign-extend first; a separate SImode operand
  variable blocks the narrowing and keeps `sll/sra` + `negu`-on-extended
  (mission_score_screen).
- **ARRAY_REF gate**: `c-typeck.c:1406` builds an ARRAY_REF only when the operand
  has ARRAY_TYPE **and is not an INDIRECT_REF**. A pointer-to-array cast
  `(*(T (*)[N])p)[i]` is an INDIRECT_REF → index-first arithmetic; a one-field
  wrapper struct `((Wrap *)p)->a[i]` is a COMPONENT_REF → base-first, no frame
  rematerialisation (AddEnemy cluster D).
- **fold: `A op 0 ? A : -A` → ABS_EXPR** (fold-const.c) — but only the GE spelling;
  the LT ternary re-binds `arg1` after swapping arms so the abs check misses and
  expansion takes the branchy path (SoundEx, UpdateMotion). `x >= 0 ? x : -x`,
  `__builtin_abs(x)`, and an assigned builtin are IDENTICAL post-fold
  (ChasetoTarget, by direct experiment). Open-coded `t = x; if (x < 0) t = -x;`
  never reaches ABS_EXPR.
- **fold reassociation**: `split_tree` builds `a - (C - b)` as `(a - C) + b` and
  `a - (b - C)` as `(a + C) - b` (it builds, does not refold); the naive
  `a - C + b` is reassociated to `a + (b - C)` (HangCheck). `A + (B + C)`
  canonicalises to `(A + C) + B` — the constant migrates to the first operand
  (vfree, MoveKorogari).
- **`x & (1 << n)` (variable n) always canonicalises to `(x >> n) & 1`**
  (`srav`+`andi`) — verified standalone; the literal `sllv`+`and` shape needs a
  named `mask = 1 << n` first.
- **`expand_assignment` is LHS-first** for COMPONENT_REF/ARRAY_REF destinations
  (`get_inner_reference` + offset expand precede the RHS expand) — measured: RTL
  moves, bytes identical when the multiset already matched (nullcheck).
- **expand evaluates a binary op's operands left-to-right**, so the LEFT operand's
  pseudo is born first and lives longer (binop-operand-seed's mechanism).
- **EXPAND_SUM special-cases a mult-by-constant subterm inside an address** —
  it expands FIRST regardless of source order; a shift spelling or a named value
  temp preserves source order (`arr[a + b*c]`). `form_sum` sorts a CONSTANT term
  last: `(plus reg_index CONST)` emits index-first `addu` (mission_score_screen).
- **`expand_case`** builds a value-sorted compare tree over a FRESH index load but
  lays case bodies in SOURCE order; a case ending in `return` is pushed later
  (LayoutEnemyOption, Makibishi). An if/goto ladder CSEs the load and compares
  small unsigned types `sltiu`.
- **`store_flag`** cannot put the constant in the immediate field for `>`:
  `cond = x > K-1` folds to `lui`/`slt` vs `K<<16`; `cond = x < K` is the natural
  `slti` (FUN_8005a7a4).
- **`main` gets an implicit `__main()` call** inserted by gcc; writing it
  explicitly compiles a second call (main).

## Modes, parameters, frames

- **`promote_mode` is the IDENTITY on this target**: mips.h defines no
  `PROMOTE_MODE` and no `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED`. Never reason about which types
  it moves (FUN_80057b80's closed-form park proof, in its header).
- **Narrow locals are genuine QI/HI pseudos** (`reg/v:QI`, `reg/v:HI`); a narrow
  local always needs a real extension and can never produce a bare `move` at a
  join (ActivateHumans). A `short`→`short` copy coalesces to NOTHING; routing
  through an SImode temp restores the truncating move (ControlTraceLine 167→10).
- **`assign_parms` (function.c:4142)** emits arg-register copies in declaration
  order UNLESS `nominal_mode != passed_mode`; then the real assignment is deferred
  into `conversion_insns`, flushed after all parms — so a narrow first parameter's
  copy gets a LUID greater than every other parm copy. Used as a VALUE the
  deferred insn stays a bare `move` (truncation is lazy, at uses: cd_control);
  used as a POINTER BASE the deferred insn IS the truncation (`andi`/`sll;sra`).
  `DECL_ARG_TYPE` overrides the declared type only for float→double and the
  C_PROMOTING_INTEGER_TYPE_P (char/short) list (c-decl.c:5048-5065, 5437-5444).
- **A promoted `short` parameter is TWO pseudos for free**: the raw SImode
  arg-register copy plus the HImode declared variable (Sound).
- **Frame slots are assigned in THREE phases**: `assign_parms` (addressable
  params) → `expand_decl` (declared locals) → reload's `alter_reg` (spilled
  pseudos, in pseudo-number order). A declared local can never sit above a reload
  spill (FUN_80032720's park proof, in its header).
- **`assign_stack_local` assigns slots in declaration order**, ascending from the
  outgoing-arg boundary, each BLKmode local rounded up to 8 bytes — slot order is
  arithmetic, not searchable (FUN_80018f00; AdtMessageBox: each separately
  declared aggregate is individually rounded; LoadConstruction: odd 20-byte
  aggregates spaced 24 apart are N separate locals).
- **`mips_expand_epilogue` ALWAYS lets reorg pull the sp-restore into `jr ra`'s
  delay slot** for a trivial frame — a bare `nop` there with the restore before
  the jump is another compiler (the SDK-boundary tell; verified via `.dbr` +
  sources).
- **A varargs `&fmt + sizeof(fmt)` computed at entry** is held in a callee-saved
  register across the whole function; inline at the call site it uses a
  caller-saved temp (AdtMessageBox vs FUN_8005fe38).

## cse

- **cse hashes memory by ADDRESS RTX**: a store through a pinned register base
  cannot forward to a load spelled sp-relative — two spellings of one field are
  two cse identities (FadeOutDirect).
- **A struct store kills store-to-load forwarding for EVERY offset off that
  base** — `memrefs_conflict_p`'s offset math predicts dismissal that does not
  happen; bisect before believing it (GetAreaMapVector).
- **cse1 ends its extended block at every CODE_LABEL and at
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END`; cse2 runs `after_loop=1` with a WIDER block and crosses
  loop notes.** `make_regs_eqv` promotes a copy's dest to canonical only if it
  outlives the block — so cse2 can fold back a copy cse1 kept
  (GetAreaMapVector). A fence can never permanently split same-value `lui`s.
- **`record_jump_equiv`** records a guard's comparison on its FIRST slt operand's
  quantity (GetConflictResult), and on a `beq reg,CONST` taken edge records
  pseudo==constant — surviving calls (ProcItemGun's literal case stores).
- **`find_best_addr`** rewrites `MEM(ptr)` to `MEM(base+K)` only where the
  defining equivalence is in cse1's table — rebuilt at every multi-predecessor
  label; nonzero offsets are never folded (FUN_8004c59c).
- **cse's tables do not follow the taken edge** of a branch — constants proven on
  the fallthrough path are unavailable in branch-taken bodies (the nested-switch
  fresh `li` fact).
- **cse has a (set REG0 REG1) copy-swap special case for ADJACENT pairs**
  (`prev_nonnote_insn` adjacency): `la` + copy back-to-back gets rewritten so the
  la lands in the copy's dest (AddMisc).
- **`MEM_IN_STRUCT_P` alias heuristic (cse.c and sched.c)**: a varying-address
  struct-member store does not invalidate a fixed-address non-struct scalar's
  cached load (ActHANG vs ActSYURI d-global reloads); sched.c:860
  `anti_dependence` dismisses load→store only when the LOAD is `/s` varying and
  the STORE is non-struct fixed. A width-forcing cast `*(u16 *)&p->field` is an
  INDIRECT_REF and CLEARS `/s` (HumanActionControl's 11 bytes).

## combine

- **combine fuses `(set (reg:HI N) (mem:HI))` + `sll` + `sra` into one `lh` only
  when N has ONE use** (`added_sets_2`); with two reads of a short field the
  original `lhu` survives for the narrow use — the lever is which read comes
  first (nullcheck; the (u16) cast is a same-mode no-op there).
- **`s16 local = p->field;` does NOT pin the load** — combine relocates the fused
  sign-extend load to its USE; declaration order and s32 flips are inert.
- **`num_sign_bit_copies` elides a redundant call-arg narrow only for a
  single-assignment `(s16)`-cast local** (AddEnemy).
- **combine merges a compare into its branch and `find_split_point` re-splits AT
  the branch** — you cannot park a statement between a compare and its branch;
  the compare's shape changes too (`sra/slti` → `lui/slt`).
- **A reference combine later folds away still counts in `reg_n_refs`** — a
  provable no-op use (`(X & 0x7fffffff) << 2`) is a free ref across a
  `floor_log2` step (vmemoryGC's 12-byte park; vfree's mask second use).

## loop.c

- **The hoist gate**: `threshold * savings * lifetime >= insn_count`,
  `threshold0 = (loop_has_call ? 1 : 2) * (1 + n_non_fixed_regs)` = 29 here,
  **decaying by 3 per movable already moved** (loop.c:1640, 1728). A
  `high/lo_sum` pair gets savings 2 / lifetime 2 from `force_movables`
  (loop.c:1200) → scores 116 (SetBleedsDir vs SetBleeds: identical movable,
  opposite verdicts, discriminator = the loop's real insn count). A value live
  across a loop scores ~1102 vs insn_count ~37 — three orders clear is not a
  lever (PRICE it: `rtldump --loop-log`).
- **The move gates are TWO stages** (loop.c:691-708): gate 1 is the DISJUNCTION
  (1) used only in the set's own block (`reg_in_basic_block_p` — which also
  requires the LAST USE in that block, loop.c:1066) OR (2) `!REG_USERVAR_P &&
  !REG_LOOP_TEST_P` OR (3) guaranteed executed; gate 2 is
  `invariant_p && (n_times_set == 1 || consec_sets_invariant_p) && !trap`.
  `n_times_set == 1` is a disjunct, not a requirement (AddEnemy rounds 9/10).
- **`maybe_never` is set past ANY `CODE_LABEL` or `JUMP_INSN`**, not merely a
  backward jump.
- **`combine_movables` merges same-value set-once movables** (multi-USE members
  merge fine — `n_times_used` is a copy of `n_times_set`), summing savings and
  lifetimes into the first head; hoists emit in scan order of each group head,
  ALL after any source preheader insn (mission_score_screen's 76-byte drop).
- **BLOCK_BEG/END notes receive luids** (loop.c:404) but are not insns — a bare
  `{ s32 pad; }` scope block stretches a movable's lifetime for free.
- **`reg_single_usage`**: loop.c substitutes-and-deletes a set-once single-use
  register copy inside a call-containing loop when the folded address stays
  legitimate (`CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P` absolute addresses qualify); a `tmp = n;` copy
  cannot block invariance. Dead probes never reach loop.c
  (`delete_trivially_dead_insns` iterates first).
- **giv inits are emitted by `strength_reduce` (loop.c:6405) AFTER
  `move_movables`** — the only thing that can legally sit after a hoist in a
  preheader is a giv init; a source statement can only precede the hoists
  (AddEnemy's `names_offset` non-variable).
- **`move_movables` emits with `emit_insn_before(loop_start)`** — a hoisted set
  escapes any enclosing fence's notes, so ballast cannot weight it (AddEnemy).
- **Identical invariant else-arm constants COMBINE, so their hoist savings SUM**
  (SetBleeds' three per-arm `negu`s; solo `zN - x` spellings keep them separate).
- **A `short` loop counter suppresses strength reduction** (loop.c needs a plain
  SImode giv) — the recompute-from-base shape (SetupMotionRegist).
- **`duplicate_loop_exit_test` (jump.c)** fires only when `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` is
  immediately followed by a simplejump → the bottom-test do-while shape;
  `while(1){if(!c)break;…}` keeps the top test AND loop notes; a hand `goto` loop
  has no notes at all — no hoisting, no strength reduction, no VTOP.
- **Loop-body refs count DOUBLE in flow2** for a real loop vs a goto shape at
  identical bytes (DamageControl lesson 3).

## Register allocation

- **A pseudo's live range is NEVER split**: one C variable = one hard register
  for its whole life. Two hard regs for one logical value in the target = the
  original had two variables; the converse proves nothing — disjoint halves fall
  back onto the same free register (AttackBowControl).
- **There is no coalescing pass.** Non-conflicting allocnos land on the same
  register and copies vanish as self-moves; `global_conflicts` processes
  `REG_DEAD` before `mark_reg_store`, so a value dying AT an op never conflicts
  with its consumer — INSEPARABLE, no spelling can split them (SetupSpline;
  `regalloc` prints the verdict).
- **Priority** = `floor_log2(n_refs) * n_refs / live_length * 10000 * size`
  (global.c `allocno_compare`); **n_refs is LOOP-DEPTH-WEIGHTED** — each RTL
  mention adds its loop depth (`.lreg`'s printed count is already weighted).
  `floor_log2` steps at powers of two — one ref can swing 15000→21333. Ties break
  by pseudo number. `.greg`'s `;; N regs to allocate:` line is printed AFTER the
  qsort — it IS the allocation order (`regalloc --order` self-validates against
  it; 12 functions / 267 allocnos, zero divergence; `.lreg` live_length scored
  0 violations across 53 adjacent pairs where `.flow`'s scored 15).
- **`find_reg` walks hard registers numerically** (MIPS defines no
  `REG_ALLOC_ORDER`): first-allocated wins the LOWER register; `$s8` = `$30` is
  the LAST callee-saved scanned, so a high-ref value in `$s8` ranked BELOW its
  neighbours (mission_score_screen chased this backwards).
- **`set_preference` strips exactly ONE RTX level** to operand 0 and bails unless
  it finds a REG — `(set X (plus a b))` donates a's colour to X;
  `(set X (plus (plus a b) c))` donates NOTHING. It maps through `reg_renumber`,
  so a local_alloc'd pseudo donates as a HARD register; it fires on uses too.
- **`expand_preferences` unions preferences BOTH WAYS** between a SET_DEST global
  and any non-conflicting global carrying a `REG_DEAD` note on that insn — a
  global can inherit a preference it never touched (ControlHumanoid: the lever
  was two variables away).
- **`regs_someone_prefers[A]`** = union of full-prefs of LOWER-priority
  CONFLICTING allocnos minus A's own; an allocno's OWN preference is the only
  thing that reclaims such a register (find_reg's preference pass re-copies
  `used` from conflicts-only `used1`).
- **A single-use value assigned straight into a call argument cannot donate a
  copy preference** — combine folds the pair and flow deletes the dead def; it
  needs ≥2 uses to survive as a donor.
- **local_alloc colours quantities shortest-lived-first**; the first coloured
  takes `$v0`. `QTY_CMP_PRI` uses the same loop-depth-weighted refs, so fences
  re-rank short-lived constants too. Seeds: `copy-seed` / `binop-operand-seed`
  exploit birth order.
- **`combine_regs` refuses a tie when the source pseudo crosses a block
  boundary** (`reg_qty == -1`) — the `%hi` reload tie; duplicated per-arm calls
  make the argument pseudo block-local (FileRead, PrepareAccess, AfsOpen).
- **`update_equiv_regs`**: REG_EQUIV attaches to the SET_DEST's regno only, iff
  `REG_BASIC_BLOCK >= 0` (one block) and the MEM is unchanged for the register's
  life; it doubles REG_LIVE_LENGTH; `reg_n_sets == 2` skips the pseudo. A note on
  a pseudo that GOT a hard register is INERT (reload1.c keys on
  `reg_renumber[N] < 0`). A stack parameter used exactly once (REG_N_REFS==2) is
  load-sunk to its use (AdtSelect trap; AddMisc; `regalloc --notes` prints owner
  + liveness).
- **`REG_N_DEATHS == 1` gates local tying** (`reg_qty = -2` seed): a value that
  dies on two paths can never be locally tied — duplicate the consuming copy into
  both arms to REFUSE a tie (mission_score_screen's medal temp).
- **`optimize_reg_copy_1` lives in local-alloc.c** (no regmove.c in 2.8.1):
  propagates `dst = src` forward over a block; the scan breaks on CODE_LABEL,
  JUMP_INSN, or NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END, and the guard is
  `!find_reg_note(insn, REG_DEAD, SET_SRC)`. A fence must ENCLOSE the copy to
  block it (ProcItemSmoke, ActSTICKON).
- **A hard-conflict cannot be outranked**: if the desired hard register is in the
  allocno's `;; conflicts:` list, no priority change works — change lifetime,
  identity, or the interference graph (AddEnemy's `category = 0` fence: order
  flipped exactly as computed, zero bytes moved).

## reload

- **The self-tie retype gate** (reload.c:3806-3855) fires iff the operand is NOT
  itself reloaded (`operand_reloadnum < 0`), converting INPADDR/INPUT_ADDRESS
  reloads to `RELOAD_FOR_OPERAND_ADDRESS`, which bars sharing. `branch_zero`'s
  `'d'` constraint reloads the operand, so `if (x == 0)` self-ties; `p->field`
  through movsi's `'m'` never does (AdtSelect's header carries the full proof).
- **`allocate_reload_reg` round-robins from `last_spill_reg`**
  (reload1.c:5082-5091): one extra reload anywhere shifts every later reload
  register — a reload-register diff downstream of a reload-COUNT diff is ONE
  root cause.
- **Reload rewrites a spilled movable's insn IN PLACE into the remat and emits
  the real store at a NEW uid** — dependents keep pointing at the remat, the
  store inherits priority 1 and sinks (mission_score_screen; `.sched`-vs-`.dbr`
  UID check).
- **A spilled hoisted pseudo is rematerialised from its REG_EQUAL note after
  sched1** — `lui/addiu` glued to the `sw` that no scheduler can separate
  (SetBleedsDir).
- **`reload_cse_regs` (toplev.c:3501)** runs between `.greg` and `.sched2` with
  NO dump of its own; it UNCONDITIONALLY rewrites a constant SET_SRC into a copy
  from the first hard register (scanning regno 0 up) already holding the value;
  `$zero` can never win (only observed sets populate `reg_values`); it forgets
  everything at a CODE_LABEL. So target `move rX,zero` PROVES a label intervenes
  between the two zeroes (GetNearestHumanoid; diagnose with
  `rtldump --pass all --trace <uid>`).
- **Huge-frame TUs (offsets past ±32767)** spill params to arg-home slots once
  the callee-saved file is full; every use rematerialises li/addu/lw through
  reload's spill registers — an a3/t0 rotation there is reload structure, not
  regalloc (AdtSelect).

## Scheduling (sched.c) and reorg

- **Both schedulers are BACKWARD list schedulers**: T-1 is the block's LAST slot,
  filled first — an insn picked earlier lands LATER. Ready-list ties go to the
  HIGHEST LUID. "Emit first" = "lose the ranking".
- **`priority()` (sched.c:1452) maxes over LOG_LINKS — PREDECESSORS** — it is
  depth-from-top, not height-to-bottom (that is later-gcc behaviour).
  `ref_count` counts CONSUMERS and does not feed priority — confusing the two
  inverted a correct park once.
- **`adjust_priority` (sched.c:2535) bumps a BIRTHING insn to LAUNCH_PRIORITY
  (0x7f000001) at launch time**: pattern `(set (REG) …)`, dest live,
  `REG_N_SETS(dest) == 1`; gated on `reload_completed == 0`, NOT on an
  ADJUST_PRIORITY macro. The `;; insn[N]: priority` TABLE is not what the
  scheduler used — read the `;; ready list at T-k:` lines (`schedtrace` names
  bumped insns). A `(set (SUBREG …) …)` dest is never birthing — every compound
  assignment to a short local. A re-assigned local (`REG_N_SETS != 1`) silently
  loses the bump (CreateHumanoid).
- **`rank_for_schedule`'s class key tests LOG_LINKS of the LAST SCHEDULED insn**
  (its producers), with an `insn_cost == 1` escape — making a dependence cost ≠ 1
  flips an equal-priority tie without touching LUID (FUN_80057b80's header).
- **All-latency-1 blocks cannot be reordered by sched** (sched.c:1521's own
  comment) — only a LOAD (cost 2) differentiates; a misplaced insn in a load-free
  block is SOURCE ORDER.
- **Equal-priority `potential_hazard` swaps happen only within an equal-priority
  group** — demoting one contender by a point dissolves the group; a store fed by
  a LOAD holds priority N+1 via load-use cost 2, a store fed by an ALU op sits
  one lower (HumanActionControl).
- **sched's equal-priority tiebreak prefers the memory-unit insn**: [alu][store]
  from a simultaneously-ready pair; the fix is a real source dependency
  (store-forwarded re-read), not permutation (FileOption).
- **Loop notes are sched barriers**: the first real insn after
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END` receives a full pending-register/memory dependency
  (`reg_pending_sets_all`); mid-block loop notes are full barriers in
  `sched_analyze_insn`.
- **sched1 runs before reload; the prologue does not exist yet** — parm-copy and
  prologue ordering questions live ONLY in sched2 (`schedtrace --pass sched2`).
  sched2 runs BEFORE jump2 (the `.jump2` dump already carries sched2's lists) —
  a second `return` pins an epilogue `sra` above the restores
  (turn_towards_player_).
- **An argument-register move is LUID-last** (calls.c:1632 precomputes all
  register parameters before filling any hard reg) — but **argmoves are NOT
  pinned to priority 1** (the old "permanent scheduling floor — park on sight"
  rule is REFUTED, 2026-07-17): `move aN,rX` depends on rX's producer, and on
  the rule's own cited function 23 of 30 argmoves sit above priority 1 (one at
  53). Run `tools/sched-deps.py <Name> --pass sched2` — it prints that census
  as a falsification, never a park verdict. Priority 1 means UNIT LATENCY, not
  "no producers".
- **reorg (`.dbr`)**: `fill_simple_delay_slots` scans backward and stops at
  labels/jumps/SEQUENCEs; loads are ineligible for MIPS delay slots
  (`dslot=yes`); a 2+-use label (`own_target=0`) blocks the steal; the
  fallthrough can never fill an inline `if (c) return 0;` guard's slot (it is
  already a SEQUENCE) — what leads the SKIP LABEL decides (StickonCheck's header
  carries the four-guard control experiment).
- **`mostly_true_jump` scans BACKWARD from the branch target over NOTES ONLY**;
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` → returns 2 (mostly-taken) → reorg raids the TARGET
  thread first (+1 COPY of the merge block's leader, label redirected); predicted
  not-taken raids the fallthrough it owns (−1 MOVE). The flip has a DIRECTION
  (LoadTIMpack wanted the copy; StickonCheck's EQ guard already predicted 0).
- **reorg deletes a same-address reload only if the register is untouched
  between** store and reload (redundant-insn elimination; absent from
  cse/combine dumps) — to keep a "redundant" reload, redefine the register in
  the interval (ReqItemUse).
- **reorg steals a shared block's first insn and retargets THROUGH it** — N
  rejects with sentinels in delay slots are the post-reorg view of N
  `goto reject;` sites; the site still pointing at the real block had a full
  slot (DrawModelArchive, DrawClip).
- **An `abssi2` is ONE `multi`-type insn through reorg** (template carries its
  own branch) — invisible to delay-slot filling; the open-coded form exposes a
  real `bgez` that steals (DamageControl lesson 1, FUN_80056910).
- **cc1 emits `.set reorder`** — a `bgez` delay slot can be filled by the
  ASSEMBLER; cc1's own dbr only considers the single preceding insn.
- **`x = 0` compiles to `move r,$0`, never `addiu r,$zero,0`** — the target byte
  form `addiu r,$zero,0` is unreachable from plain C (the draw*/DrawTMD
  handwritten-family tell; docs/gte-policy.md).

## jump / cross-jump

- **`find_cross_jump` scans backward and gives up when stream 1 reaches a
  CODE_LABEL** (it skips labels only in stream 2) — a referenced `case` label is
  a hard cross-jump fence (StateTransition).
- **Cross-jump compares whole insns**: a `CALL_INSN`'s result mode and
  `CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE` distinguish machine-identical `jal`s (ActATTACK);
  algebraically equal `x*3+480` vs `(x+160)*3` do not present the same suffix
  (FUN_800519bc).
- **`jump_optimize(insns,1,1,0)` — the only cross_jump=1 call (toplev.c:3548) —
  runs AFTER combine and AFTER allocation**: never infer pre-jump2 block
  structure or allocation constraints from final asm (FUN_80057b80 494→8;
  ActSTICKON's "register cycle" was a jump2 artifact). jump1 hoists a common
  leading insn out of identical arms — a dead store in one arm keeps the heads
  different.
- **Guard `return 0;` islands all cross-jump into the LAST plain island in
  emission order** (HangCheck); `make_return_insns` converts a jump-to-next
  return into its own `jr` when a bare CODE_LABEL survives (GetConflictResult).
- **A lone-jump body is foldable**: `if (cond) goto retK;` lets jump.c delete the
  join label that an inline `if (cond) return K;` would leave — cse's block then
  spans the call (the redundant `move aN,sM` fix).

## Assembler / maspsx layer

- **ASPSX gp-addresses only symbols defined in the TU being assembled**; externs
  are absolute. Per-file `maspsxGpExterns` in Build.hs encodes the original TU's
  smalls (toolchain.md). A missing entry silently relocates whole data regions —
  `symcheck.py` catches it (`D_<HEX>` must equal `0x<HEX>`).
- **-msplit-addresses is effectively ON**: non-small externs compile to
  HIGH/LO_SUM through allocated registers; ≤ -G8 smalls keep the one-insn macro
  expanded via `$at` (stores) or the dest reg (loads). `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO`
  (mips.h) sets `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG` iff the decl's type is COMPLETE and
  `0 < sizeof <= 8` — `extern T x[];` is incomplete and always splits; a complete
  type of size ≤ 8 gives the same-register unsplit `la` (RestoreItemLayout's
  one-character fix). Offset-0 accesses fold `%lo` into the displacement; a
  nonzero constant offset forces full materialisation of the DECLARED symbol's
  own address (never partially absorbing the offset).
- **Variable division needs maspsx `--expand-div`** to reproduce ASPSX's
  `break 7` (÷0) and, for signed div, `break 6` guards; `maspsxflags.py --write`
  syncs it (with the gp lists) from the target asm.
- **maspsx `nop # DEBUG:` comment lines QUOTE instructions** — strip `#` to EOL
  before counting anything; in a gte.h function `swc2 $17,…` is COP2 reg 17, not
  `$s1`.
- **maspsx `break` takes the single-value form** (`break 0x107`), not objdump's
  two-operand rendering.
- The canonical cc1 reads the **low** halfword for `(short)(int)` truncation; a
  high-half `lhu` (offset+2) means the old non-canonical binary crept back in.
