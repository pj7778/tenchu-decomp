# Relocatable loaded data

`tools/reloc_audit.py` initially found a conservative set of 185 aligned
literal words in loaded data that point back into the movable MAIN.EXE image.
The current generated-input topology reports 184; use the live audit rather
than treating either historical count as an invariant. This is a much cleaner
problem than the raw-code candidates:

- every initial and current candidate source word is in trailing owner
  `72CD0.data.s`;
- every target is in the leading-data range;
- the targets inspected so far are exact string or string-pool entry starts;
  and
- the generated owner around a target is often broader than the object being
  addressed, so rewriting a pointer as `D_800xxxxx + addend` would invent an
  ownership claim.

The initial owner distribution is useful for batching the work:

| Generated source owner | Pointers |
|---|---:|
| `D_8008EA90` | 76 |
| `CD_comstr` | 32 |
| `ThinkDB` | 18 |
| `CD_intstr` | 8 |
| Nine coherent four-entry tables | 36 |
| `WeaponModel` | 3 |
| Twelve singletons | 12 |

This inventory is conservative. It says that the word is aligned and falls in
the movable range; table structure, type, and symbol naming still require
review.

## Representation

`tools/reloc_data.py` applies `config/reloc-data.main.exe.json` to copies of
Splat's generated assembly. Each reviewed manifest entry records:

- the pointer's generated file, exact address, and enclosing `dlabel` owner;
- the target's generated file, exact address, and enclosing owner; and
- a human-readable symbol for the exact target.

The transformer inserts a section-relative object label directly at the
target and changes only the pointer operand from a literal to that symbol. For
example, the representation is conceptually:

```asm
/* exact interior target inside the larger generated string-pool owner */
.globl stage_sound_prefix_default
.type stage_sound_prefix_default, @object
stage_sound_prefix_default:
    .asciz "K:\\WORK\\CDIMAGE\\SOUND\\"

STAGE_SOUND_PREFICES:
    .word stage_sound_prefix_english
    .word stage_sound_prefix_french
    .word stage_sound_prefix_italian
    .word stage_sound_prefix_default
```

The enclosing generated owner is only an evidence guard. It is deliberately
not used as the relocation base. This prevents a label at `0x80013524` from
silently becoming `D_80013500 + 0x24`, a top-level relationship not supported
by the data itself.

The tool refuses stale or ambiguous input: wrong owners, missing addresses,
changed pointer literals, duplicate sources, symbol/target conflicts, and
attempts to overwrite the generated input directory all fail before any
output is written.

## Reviewed slices

The committed manifest covers eight clear, game-owned language tables. The
first slice was:

- `STAGE_SOUND_PREFICES` at `0x8008EA58..0x8008EA64`; and
- `STAGE_ANIMATION_PREFICES` at `0x8008EA68..0x8008EA74`.

The second slice adds six adjacent, named four-entry tables:

- `ITEM_SEL_SPRITE_PTRS`;
- `RS_ARCHIVE_PTRS`;
- `RANK_ARCHIVE_PTRS` and `RANKS_ARCHIVE_PTRS`, which deliberately share the
  same four targets;
- `TRN_SPRITE_PTRS`; and
- `GOV_ARCHIVE_PTRS`.

Their strings spell the English, French, Italian, and Japanese filenames in
the same order as the tables. Together the two slices cover 32 pointer words
and 28 exact targets across `207C.data.s`, `2EB0.data.s`, and
`72CD0.data.s`. The names are supported by the source table names and literal
string contents. No wider type or top-level target symbol is inferred.

Validate the manifest against a generated tree without writing anything:

```console
$ tools/reloc_data.py \
    --manifest config/reloc-data.main.exe.json \
    --input-dir .shake/gen/main.exe/asm/data \
    --check
reloc-data: validated 32 pointer words and 28 exact targets across 3 files
```

Or write separate assembly inputs directly:

```console
$ tools/reloc_data.py \
    --manifest config/reloc-data.main.exe.json \
    --input-dir .shake/gen/main.exe/asm/data \
    --output-dir .shake/build/reloc-data/asm
```

Only the three touched files are emitted. The default matching lane still
consumes Splat's files unchanged.

The standalone build gate applies the transform to temporary copies, assembles
the touched objects, and performs the controlled links described below:

```console
$ ./Build check-reloc-data
reloc-data-lane: verified 32 R_MIPS_32 pointer words, 28 exact targets, and 3 link layouts across 3 files
check-reloc-data: reviewed pointer tables are retail-exact and shift-relocatable
```

The same manifest transformation is composed into `./Build relink`: its
`207C`, `2EB0`, and `72CD0` objects replace the literal generated inputs, with
the BSS transform applied after the `72CD0` pointer rewrite. The standalone
gate remains the stricter per-record and controlled-shift oracle. This removes
32 blockers from the real relink, but does not make the remaining raw pointers
or code safe.

## Binutils proof

The proof uses GNU MIPS assembler and linker output, not a source-level
assumption:

- in the current generated tree, unmodified `72CD0.data.s.o` has 403
  `R_MIPS_32` records and the rewritten object has 435;
- the 32 additions are individually required to be `R_MIPS_32` at their exact
  reviewed source offsets and against their exact target symbols;
- each target symbol is section-relative at the expected interior offset in
  `207C.data.s.o` or `2EB0.data.s.o`, never `ABS`;
- a retail-address partial link reproduces all 32 shipped pointer words;
- moving all touched loaded-data inputs by `+4` increments every pointer by
  `+4`; and
- moving them by `+0x10004` increments every pointer by `+0x10004`, including
  the high-word carry.

The focused test performs the same assemble/readelf/link checks with hermetic
fixtures when MIPS binutils are available:

```console
$ python3 -m unittest -v \
    tools.tests.test_reloc_data tools.tests.test_reloc_data_lane
```

Applying the manifest to the current generated `72CD0.data.s` reduces its live
literal-pointer candidates from 184 to 152. The ordinary generated input is
unchanged; the composed normal relink consumes the transformed copy.

## Scaling without inventing source

Continue by coherent owner, not by blindly replacing every aligned word. The
next strong candidates are `CD_comstr`/`CD_intstr`, `ThinkDB`, and the repeated
language/stage records under `D_8008EA90`. For every batch:

1. confirm the exact target directive and enclosing owner;
2. name the exact interior object, not an enclosing blob plus a guessed addend;
3. require retail bytes plus `R_MIPS_32` in assembler output;
4. require controlled `+4` and `+0x10004` links; and
5. migrate to typed C tables only when PSX.SYM, headers, or uses establish the
   genuine type.

Symbolic assembly remains an honest, editable relocation-bearing source form
when a stronger type is not yet known. This is the loaded-data counterpart to
the symbolic/original-object policy in [relocatable-build.md](relocatable-build.md).
