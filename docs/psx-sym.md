# PSX.SYM — the original source's names and types

The Japanese demo disc (`Rittai Ninja Katsugeki Tenchu (Japan) (Demo)`, PAPX-90029,
1997-10-26) shipped `PSX.SYM` inside its AFS archive, alongside leftover build-pipeline
junk (`VOLMAKE.BAT`, `AFSMAKE.EXE`). It is the Psy-Q linker's debug output — the
authors' own source file names, function prototypes with parameter names, struct /
union / enum layouts with field names, line numbers, and the `static`-vs-`extern`
storage class of every symbol.

boricj found it and [wrote it up](https://boricj.net/tenchu1/2024/04/01/part-8.html);
our Ghidra symbols descend from his version-tracking of it. But that propagation was
lossy, and it only ever carried *names*. The types, prototypes and translation-unit
structure never reached us. They have now.

## Getting it

```console
$ tools/extract-demo.py ~/Downloads/PAPX90029.BIN -o disks/demo
```

Walks the MODE2/2352 ISO9660 tree, pulls `TENCHU.VOL`, walks its AFS directory
(36-byte big-endian records, `IX` signature) and carves `PSX.SYM` plus the demo
executables. `disks/` is gitignored; the extractor asserts
`sha1(PSX.SYM) = ffc15ac96e595a2c073529b368be8bcc53a52bcd`.

## Resuming from cold

Everything derived is committed under `reference/`. Only the inputs are not, because
they are copyrighted game data (`disks/` is gitignored). To rebuild the world:

```console
$ tools/extract-demo.py ~/Downloads/PAPX90029.BIN -o disks/demo   # PSX.SYM + PSX.EXE
$ tools/symdump.py                                                # -> reference/psxsym-*
```

`reference/demo-psxexe.functions.tsv` and `.labels.tsv` are the demo `PSX.EXE`'s
Ghidra names (boricj's PSX.SYM propagation), which the three matchers match *against*
and then re-filter through `PSX.SYM` for provenance. Regenerate them with:

```console
$ ghidra-analyzeHeadless <proj_dir> \
    'tenchu-decompile/Rittai Ninja Katsugeki - Tenchu (Japan) (Demo)/TENCHU.VOL/CDIMAGE' \
    -process 'PSX.EXE' -noanalysis -readOnly -scriptPath tools/ghidra \
    -postScript ExportFunctionsLabels.java \
    reference/demo-psxexe.functions.tsv reference/demo-psxexe.labels.tsv
```

The matchers also read `.shake/ghidra-export/functions.tsv` (see
[ghidra-bridge.md](ghidra-bridge.md)) and `disks/tenchu/main.exe`.

Then, to look for more names:

```console
$ tools/symmatch.py --candidates reference/psxsym-candidates.tsv \
                    --unplaced   reference/psxsym-unplaced.tsv \
                    --left       reference/psxsym-unnamed.tsv
$ tools/xbuildnames.py --apply /tmp/x.tsv
$ tools/callmatch.py   --apply /tmp/c.tsv
$ tools/callmatch.py   --verify /tmp/x.tsv          # ALWAYS, before adopting
$ tools/import_symbols.py --renames /tmp/x.tsv      # rebuilds + gates on ./Build check
$ tools/datamatch.py --apply /tmp/d.tsv             # re-run after ANY function renames
```

`import_symbols.py --renames` both renames existing symbols and **defines new ones**
(rewriting splat's `D_800BC108` auto-label across `src/`, the gp-extern lists in
`Build.hs`/`permute.py`, and the yaml), then gates on a byte-identical `./Build check`.

## Reading it

`tools/psxsym.py` parses the `MND` format: an 8-byte header then a stream of
`u32 offset ; u8 tag ; payload`. The tag table is in the module docstring. It parses
the whole 1.48 MB to EOF with **zero unknown tags** and reproduces the 1097 functions
Ghidra shows in `PSX.SYM.elf` — that agreement is the correctness check.

Contents: **1696 plain symbols**, **442 functions with full debug info** across
**31 source files**, **60894 type definitions**.

```console
$ tools/symdump.py            # regenerates everything under reference/
```

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `reference/psxsym-types.h` | 415 aggregates + 289 typedefs, original field names |
| `reference/psxsym-protos.h` | 442 prototypes, 308 with the authors' parameter names |
| `reference/psxsym-tu-map.tsv` | function → source file, line, frame size, saved-reg mask |
| `reference/psxsym-data.tsv` | 567 data symbols with their original types |
| `reference/psxsym-locals.tsv` | **2516 parameters and locals** across 394 functions — name, type, and where the demo build put each one |
| `reference/psxsym-statics.tsv` | 304 `static` declarations (73 functions, 231 objects) |

### Locals

The richest seam, and the last one opened. `C_REG` records a local's **register
number** (`16` = `$s0`), `C_AUTO` its **frame-pointer-relative offset** — and `$fp`
is `$sp`, so the real slot is `sp + fsize + offset`. `valloc`'s 1 KB debug buffer
lands at `sp+40`, just under the saved registers at `fsize-8`. Checks out.

```
DrawSprite  3DCTRL.C  param  $s1      struct Sprite3D *sprt
DrawSprite  3DCTRL.C  stack  sp+16    struct MATRIX mat
DrawSprite  3DCTRL.C  reg    $s1      struct ModelType *objp
DrawSprite  3DCTRL.C  stack  sp+48    short rxy[2]
```

The demo build's *register allocation* need not survive into retail, but the
**number of locals and their types** are exactly what drive cc1's codegen, and those
do. A name repeated inside one function is a distinct nested-block scope, not a
duplicate. `tools/matcher-prompt.py` prints them for the target function.

### Source-line spans

`psxsym-tu-map.tsv` carries each function's start line, and its end line **when that
can be trusted**. The `0x8E` end-of-function record is not reliable everywhere: in
`THINK_2.C` and `THINK_4.C` every function claims to end at the file's last line,
overlapping its successors. So a span is only reported when it is consistent with
where the next function in the same file starts, and — for the last function in a
file, which nothing bounds — when the implied code density is at least 2 bytes per
line (verified spans sit at a median of 13.3). 431 of 442 survive; median 24 source
lines, p90 83. Useful as a sanity prior on how much C a body should be.

`tools/matcher-prompt.py` injects the prototype, the TU and the storage class into
every matcher-agent launch prompt automatically.

**The addresses in PSX.SYM are useless.** It describes an *earlier, lost build* —
its `.text` starts at `0x8001387c`, the demo's own `PSX.EXE` at `0x8001389c`, and a
constant `+0x20` shift only reconciles 85% of the functions. Names and types transfer;
addresses do not.

## What survives the build gap

Two structural facts do:

* the linker emits each translation unit **contiguously**, and
* within a TU the compiler emits functions in **source order**.

Retail `main.exe` reproduces the demo's 31 TUs as 36 contiguous blocks. That is what
makes name recovery possible at all.

## The three matchers

Each is independent, each measures its own precision against a control set of
functions already named on both sides. Never trust one alone — see the worked failure
below.

| tool | signal | control precision | good for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tools/symmatch.py` | TU + source order, Needleman-Wunsch, scored on frame size / saved-reg mask / code size | frame+mask agree on only **63%** of anchors | game code inside the 31 debug TUs |
| `tools/xbuildnames.py` | normalized instruction identity vs demo `PSX.EXE` | **96.5%** (341 control pairs) | library / support code, unedited bodies |
| `tools/callmatch.py` | multiset of named `jal` targets | **97.9%** (94 control pairs) | anything whose body was rewritten |

`xbuildnames` masks link-time immediates (`%hi`/`%lo`, gp and stack offsets, `j`/`jal`
targets) and keeps PC-relative branch offsets, which survive relinking. Its known
failure mode is functions differing *only* in a masked immediate: it happily equates
`SpuRead` and `SpuWrite`. Uniqueness on both sides plus the PSX.SYM provenance filter
keeps that out of the proposals, but do not lower those guards.

### Verify before you adopt

```console
$ tools/callmatch.py --verify reference/psxsym-applied.tsv
```

For each proposed name it checks that the demo function's named callees are
**contained in** the retail function's (containment, not equality — retail functions
grow). This is not theoretical: `symmatch` proposed `SetPadState` for `0x80032610`
because the frame size *and* the saved-register mask both matched. The callees said
otherwise —

```
retail 0x80032610 calls: GsGetWorkBase, GsSetWorkBase, SetDrawMove, AddPrim
demo   UpdateTexScroll : GsGetWorkBase, GsSetWorkBase, SetDrawMove, AddPrim
demo   SetPadState     : GsSortSprite x5
```

— and the name was wrong. Frame/mask agreement is weak evidence on its own.
Call signature outranks it.

## What we adopted

**34 names**, all rebuilt byte-identical, listed in `reference/psxsym-applied.tsv`.
Six of them replaced *guessed* names with the originals, and the guesses corroborate
the recovery:

| our guess | original |
|---|---|
| `handle_char_state_using_item_` | `ActITEM` |
| `handle_char_state_posing_` | `ActACTION` |
| `handle_char_state_attacking_SEVEN_` | `AttackFire` |
| `think_setting_weapon_logic1_` | `Think3area` |
| `load_sprite_info_perhaps` | `SetupImageToPolyFT4` |
| `change_clear_pad_init_card_` | `InitCARD` |

## What we did NOT get, and where it went

Three lists are regenerated by `tools/symmatch.py --candidates --unplaced --left`:

* **`reference/psxsym-candidates.tsv`** — 17 names the TU alignment can suggest.
  The `LOW` rows are *not* applied: positional evidence only. Five were then actively
  **rejected** by `callmatch --verify` (`ViewAdjustBG`, `SetGore`, `GetFreeItemSlot`,
  `RequestItem`, and the `SetPadState` above). One, `AttackFire`, was rescued from
  `LOW` to adopted when its callees came back 100% contained. The rest await better
  evidence — the placeholder stays, the candidate is recorded.

* **`reference/psxsym-unplaced.tsv`** — 61 functions PSX.SYM knows that we could not
  locate. Ten each in `OPENING.C` and `OPMOVIE.C` and six in `MOJI.C` are almost
  certainly *not in `main.exe` at all* (the demo was one monolithic `PSX.EXE`; retail
  split menu/opening/ending into `MENU.EXE` and `ENDING.EXE`). The `strInit`/`strNext`/
  `open_stream` cluster is Psy-Q `libpress` streaming. The rest — `ActDEAD`, `DrawImpact`,
  `DrawTarget`, `GetScreenPosition`, `PutMoji*`, `QuakeCamera` — are real game code and
  should be findable; they are the best remaining targets.

* **`reference/psxsym-unnamed.tsv`** — 136 retail placeholders with no candidate at
  all. Roughly 60 are in the `0x8005xxxx` library region (no debug info in the SYM),
  the rest are game code added after the demo.

## Data symbols

Ordering does not transfer for data — the segment moved far more than `.text` did.
What transfers is **who touches what**. `tools/datamatch.py` decodes the data
references of every function we have named on *both* sides (`lui`/`%lo` pairs and
`$gp`-relative accesses), aligns the two instruction streams with `difflib` so
inserted/removed instructions don't shift the correspondence, and zips the reference
sequences. Each zip is one vote that retail address X is the demo's symbol Y; a
global touched by several known functions collects several independent votes.

A name is adopted only when every vote for X agrees, at least two *distinct*
functions witness it, and no other address claims the name.

Control precision — retail addresses whose current name is itself a PSX.SYM name —
is **100% (105/105)**. Note that the two apparent counter-examples in an earlier run
were not errors: our `Me_MOTION_C` is the de-duplicated spelling of the demo's static
`Me`, and `StageBosses`/`StageEnemies` at `0x80097c74`/`0x80097c76` disagree with the
demo's single `StageEnemies` short — the tool correctly refused to propose, because
the name was already taken. That pair is worth a human look.

**156 data symbols were defined**, in `reference/data-symbols-applied.tsv`:

* **35 from `datamatch`** — `struct ConflictObjectType ConflictObject[64]` (21 votes),
  `struct WeaponType WeaponDB[28]`, `short RefrectVector[16]`, `long AttackActionCount`,
  plus Psy-Q internals like `GsOUT_PACKET_P` (26 votes) and `_svm_*`.
* **121 from the Ghidra export** — already named in the Ghidra program for *this*
  binary (`PersistentState`, `MusicTable`, `CdReset`, `GsA4divTNG4`…) but never
  adopted, because `import_symbols.py` could only *rename* existing entries. It can
  now define new ones. This was free the whole time.

`reference/psxsym-globals.h` joins the 113 globals we name with PSX.SYM's original
type, and `tools/matcher-prompt.py` lists the ones a target function touches:

```
- Globals it touches, with the original declaration:
    `extern short ConflictObjects;`                          /* 0x800976ec */
    `extern struct ConflictObjectType ConflictObject[64];`   /* 0x800bc108 */
    `extern struct tag_TItem items[30];`                     /* 0x800bfbb0 */
```

14 single-vote suggestions are parked in `reference/psxsym-data-candidates.tsv`.
One witness can come from a misaligned instruction block; two independent functions
rarely agree by accident.

## Still on the table

* **The rest of the 567 globals.** 105 are matched; the remainder are touched only by
  functions we have not yet named on both sides, so naming more *functions* directly
  unlocks more *data*. The two loops feed each other — re-run `datamatch.py` after
  every batch of function renames.
* **Statics.** 73 functions and 231 objects the original build declared `static`.
  A `static` never gets a `%gp` extern and changes how the symbol is emitted; this list
  should feed `tools/gpsyms.py`.
* **The SLD stream.** We use the per-function line records but discard the
  per-instruction line deltas (`0x80`/`0x82`/`0x84`/`0x86`). Those give an
  address→source-line map for the demo build, which would let a matcher see exactly
  which instructions came from which statement.
* **Block structure.** `0x90`/`0x92` block start/end records (with line numbers) give
  the nesting depth of every function. Parsed and skipped today.
* **`MENU.EXE` / `ENDING.EXE`.** The unplaced `OPENING.C`/`OPMOVIE.C`/`MOJI.C` functions
  are presumably there — the demo was one monolithic `PSX.EXE`. Same matchers apply.

## What else the disc holds

Nothing else in `PSX.SYM` is unread: it parses to EOF with zero unknown tags, and the
only record classes we discard are the SLD deltas and block markers above.

On the disc itself:

* **`VOLMAKE.BAT`** (embedded in `TENCHU.VOL`) names the stage and enemy assets:
  `ma_akin`→`akindo`, `ma_cat`→`castle`, `ma_jyou1`→`jouka`, `ma_tan`→`tanren`,
  `ma_tem`→`temple`, `ma_yami`→`yamijou`, and enemies `rounin`, `rouban`, `echigoya`,
  `hanbe`, `jochu`, `rat`, `cat`, `dog`. Useful for naming stage/enemy tables.
* **The AFS directory preserves the original asset tree** — `K:\WORK\CDIMAGE\` with
  `ANIM`, `DEMO`, `HUMAN`, `WEAPON`, `IMAGE`, `SOUND`, `STAGE`, and per-stage
  directories `AKINDO CASTLE CAVE CAVE2 JOUKA JOUKA2 TANREN TEMPLE YAMIJOU`. 351 files:
  `.TMD` models, `.MAD`/`.AMD` animation, `.TIM`/`.TPD` textures, `.VAB` sound banks,
  `.CAD`/`.ESD` per-stage data, `.ACM`/`.CON`/`.POS` cutscene data.
* **`AFSMAKE.EXE`** (PE + DOS stub) and `$RES_UP.BAT` are the authors' build tools.
* The original tree lived at `J:\DEVELOP\PS\tenchu\tomo\NINJA_OP\`.

**The retail disc has none of this.** Its `DATA.VOL` holds 1048 files and the only
`.TXT` entries are the memory-card description strings (`CARD_J.TXT` etc.); no `.BAT`,
no `.EXE`, no `.SYM`. The demo is the single source.
