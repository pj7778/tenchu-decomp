# Orchestrating matcher agents — the runbook

How the **orchestrator** (the main session) drives byte-matching at scale by
spawning `matcher` subagents, harvesting their work, and compounding the
tooling. If you're resuming this work, read this first, then
[matching-cookbook.md](matching-cookbook.md) for the actual matching idioms.

The split of responsibility:
- **Matcher agent** (`.claude/agents/matcher.md`) — matches ONE function (or a
  bundle) in an isolated git worktree. Never commits. Reports MATCH/CURRENT(N),
  files touched, new rules, and *where it had to reason manually that a tool
  could have done the work* (that last part drives the tooling loop).
- **Orchestrator** (you) — picks targets, generates prompts, launches agents,
  **harvests on green, commits**, folds reported rules into the cookbook, and
  **builds a tool whenever a friction recurs**.

## The tool map

Everything the pipeline needs, in the order you touch it:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `tools/triage.py` | rate every function EASY..VERY-HARD + why + relevant cookbook sections; `--leverage` = call in-degree; `<Name>` = detail. Pick targets. |
| `tools/findsimilar.py [--targets]` | mnemonic-similarity ranking (nearest matched / easiest unmatched). |
| `tools/matcher-prompt.py <Name>` | **generate the agent launch prompt** — never hand-write it. Auto-fills address/size, jump-table detection, nearest matched worked-examples, TU family, and the evolving `GUIDANCE` block. Routes findsimilar-1.00 near-clones to an inline recipe. |
| `tools/reverse.py <Name> --ghidra-export .shake/ghidra-export` | split + seed the `.c` with Ghidra C **and** m2c C **and** a `triage:` line + likely-relevant docs. Adds the splat carve. |
| `tools/split-scaffold.py <Name>` | jump-table function: all INCLUDE_ASM pieces + the jtbl array + the `.rodata` carve, green before drafting. |
| `tools/xref.py <Name>` | callers (pin the prototype) + callees (matched vs needs-extern). |
| `tools/access.py <Name> [--order]` | each pointer offset's width/signedness/direction from the mnemonics; `--order` = the store sequence. Struct layout without hand-tracing `.s`. |
| `tools/gpsyms.py <Name> --write` | derive the gp-extern set from `%gp_rel` and sync Build.hs + permute.py. Shake-oracle-tracked, so it just takes effect. |
| `tools/clonematch.py <Matched>` | write the `.c` for exact byte-identical unmatched siblings (verified). |
| `tools/matchdiff.py <Name>` / `tools/asmdiff.py <Name>` | iterate. matchdiff = whole-image gate; asmdiff = aligned view for big/split functions. |
| `tools/autorules.py <Name>` | once the draft compiles: mechanically sweep the *local* cookbook rules (type-width flips; `&&` split/merge and single-use temp inline via tree-sitter) and greedily keep what shrinks the asmdiff, reporting which edit helped. Deterministic first pass; a "no win" verdict means the residual is structure/regalloc, not a local rule. |
| `tools/permute.py <Name>` | decomp-permuter for pure register-allocation ties (the stochastic search; autorules is its deterministic, explainable complement). |
| `tools/regalloc.py <Name>` | **diagnose a register tie** — runs `cc1 -dg` and surfaces which values are live across calls (forced callee-saved), the pseudo→hard-reg map, and the copy-chains that bias the coloring. Run this BEFORE blindly permuting a sub-C tie; it tells you which copy-chain to break. |

## Launching an agent

1. `tools/matcher-prompt.py <Name>` (in the nix devShell). Read its top line —
   it annotates JUMP-TABLE and the TU family, and if the target is a
   findsimilar-1.00 **near-clone** it prints an inline recipe instead: do that
   yourself (clone the twin, swap the differing constant, `matchdiff`) —
   ~2 min, no agent.
2. Otherwise paste the generated prompt into the **Agent** tool with
   `isolation: "worktree"` and the model from *Model routing* below. Background
   is fine; you're notified on completion.
3. On the completion notification: **harvest** (below), commit on green, fold
   rules, remove the worktree.

The generated prompt already carries the contract pointer, the tool workflow,
the worked examples (which self-update as more functions match), and the
cross-cutting `GUIDANCE`. **Update `GUIDANCE` in `matcher-prompt.py` (and the
cookbook) as lessons accrue** — every future launch then inherits them.

## Model routing

- **Sonnet** — sub-~800B, non-jump-table, structural-twin-of-something-matched.
  It went 4/4 on the easy tier at ~65–110k tokens each; the mid Proc* at ~96k.
- **Fable** — jump-table functions, >~1000B, heavy register-allocation surgery,
  or anything with a residual that needs reading gcc-2.8.1 sources. The
  `matcher-prompt.py` top line flags jump-table; size and float/GTE (from
  `triage.py`) flag the rest.

## Bundling: one agent for many functions

The decisive lever. Bundling amortizes fixed setup (contract/cookbook/worked-
examples/headers, paid once) **plus** whatever *investigation transfers*
between the functions. Measured over four experiments:

| What's shared between the bundled functions | Cost/fn | vs separate agents |
|---|---|---|
| Whole function — exact/near clone (findsimilar 1.00, ≤3-word diff) | ~28k | **4–5× cheaper** |
| Skeleton — structural twins (findsimilar ~0.5–0.85) | ~84k | ~30% |
| Family conventions — low-sim but same TU family (shared idioms/dispose path) | ~96k | ~15–25% |
| Nothing — independent functions | ~116k | ~none |

**Bundle by FAMILY, not just by similarity.** The mid Proc* were barely
similar to each other yet beat the independent Req stragglers, because the
ProcItem *conventions* transferred within the session. Rules of thumb:
- Tight clone cluster → **one agent, anchor-then-clone** (or do it inline
  yourself). Find them: `clonematch` (exact) or `findsimilar.py <Name>` == 1.00.
- Structural twins / same-family → **bundle ~4–5 in one agent**, one at a time,
  self-contained, tell it to **re-affirm the contract before each function**
  (multi-function sessions drift into editing the cookbook — matcher.md warns).
- Independent functions → **parallel single-function agents** (setup-only
  savings don't justify serial wall-clock + bloat risk).
- Context bloat did **not** degrade quality across 4–5 real matches in one
  session in any experiment — so ~5 is a safe bundle size; be cautious past that
  or with multiple 1000B+ functions.

Tell an agent bundling several to **stub-and-move-on** (NON_MATCHING) if one
resists, so a single hard function can't sink the session.

## Harvesting (deterministic — avoid cross-agent conflicts)

Agents branch from a point-in-time worktree; by the time they finish, `main`
has moved (other harvests). **Do not merge their config edits.** Re-derive them
with the tools instead. Per matched function, in the main tree:

```
cp <worktree>/src/main.exe/<Name>.c src/main.exe/          # the matched C
# apply any config/symbols.main.exe.txt ADDITIONS the agent reported (it has no
# comment syntax — plain `NAME = 0xADDR;` lines only)
tools/reverse.py <Name> --ghidra-export .shake/ghidra-export --no-check   # carve — NEVER hand-edit the yaml, offsets are easy to get wrong
```
If the target was **renamed via an adjacent sibling** (config/symbols has a real
name but the Ghidra export still lists `FUN_<addr>` at that address), invoke
`reverse.py FUN_<addr>` — it detects the address already carries a non-placeholder
name and writes the correctly-named `.c` (e.g. `reverse.py FUN_8001ab64` →
`handle_balmer_acm_.c`). Passing the real name fails the export lookup.
then once all are copied+carved:
```
./Build                                   # generates the split .s
tools/gpsyms.py <Name> --write            # per function; oracle picks it up
./Build
tools/matchdiff.py <Name>                 # per function → MATCH
./Build check                             # whole image byte-identical
```
Commit the `.c` + `config/splat.main.exe.yaml` + `shake/src/Build.hs` +
`tools/permute.py` (+ symbols if added) together, then
`git worktree remove <path> --force && git branch -D <branch>`.

## The reflection loop (how the tooling compounds)

After each agent, read its report's **"where I reasoned manually"** and **new
rules**:
- A new *idiom* → fold into `matching-cookbook.md` (quote the agent verbatim;
  agents don't edit it themselves). Anchor on an existing nearby rule; **verify
  the anchor string matches** (wrapped lines / backticks bite — check after).
  If the idiom is *mechanical and local* (a token/expression rewrite at an
  enumerable site — a type width, a sign toggle, a condition normalization),
  ALSO add it as a rule in `tools/autorules.py` so it's machine-applied and
  never hand-guessed again. Recognition/structural idioms (loop shape,
  switch-vs-ladder, union-offset casts, case ordering) can't be sited blindly —
  they stay cookbook-only until an AST-based transform can place them.
- A recurring *friction* → **build a tool**. That's the whole game. This session:
  agents hand-traced struct widths → `access.py`; hand-traced the store order →
  `access.py --order`; re-derived gp lists → `gpsyms.py`; the gp edit didn't
  invalidate the build → a Shake `GpFlags` oracle (the *proper* fix, not a
  cache-bust); re-scaffolded jump tables → `split-scaffold.py`; the orchestrator
  hand-wrote prompts → `matcher-prompt.py`. **Fix a tool bug centrally the
  moment the first agent hits it** — don't let N parallel agents each re-diagnose
  it (the `reverse.py` carve-drop cost ~every agent tokens before it was fixed).
- Sub-C-level residual (≤10-byte register swap / adjacent reorder surviving a
  bounded permuter run) → it's below C; root-cause it, mark NON_MATCHING, move
  on. Don't sink sessions into it (~1.4M tokens for 0 matches taught this).

## Picking targets

`tools/triage.py` (easiest first, or `--leverage` for high call in-degree, or
`--max-size N`). Prefer functions from a TU you've already touched — the shared
header (e.g. `src/main.exe/item.h`) and gp lists already exist, and the worked
examples make them near-mechanical. `findsimilar.py --targets` is the other
lens.

## Gotchas (all learned the hard way)

- **Never hand-edit `config/splat.main.exe.yaml` carves** — use `reverse.py`;
  the data-offset math is easy to get wrong (bit me twice). It preserves
  hand-added `.rodata` carves now (it used to drop them).
- **`config/symbols.main.exe.txt` has no comment syntax** — `//`/`/* */` is a
  hard splat parse error. Plain `NAME = 0xADDR;` only.
- **A whole-image `./Build check` failure while a function is mid-match is
  EXPECTED** (wrong length shifts every later object — even matched siblings
  show huge matchdiff diffs). Finish the function; don't bisect.
- **Objdump the whole EXE with `--adjust-vma (TEXT_START - 0x800)`**, not
  `TEXT_START` — the 0x800 header skews every address (this bug was silently
  wrong in `findsimilar` for a while; now fixed and it's the norm in the tools).
- Agents sometimes `cd` into the main checkout instead of their worktree
  (their bash cwd resets to the worktree each call, but an explicit `cd`
  overrides). Read-only tools are harmless there; writes aren't — the prompt
  and matcher.md both stress the worktree symlink setup.

## High-leverage backlog (do these for outsized payoff)

- **Flesh out the `Humanoid` struct** in `item.h` (character/actor state, ~724
  accesses at its 4 signature offsets alone; Ghidra `types.h` has a fuller
  candidate). It's `CamState.Owner` and every enemy/player — unlocks a large
  slice of remaining game code.
- **Easy + high-in-degree functions** (from `triage.py --leverage`): matching
  them confirms a signature for many callers. DONE so far: `UpdateCoordinate`,
  `DeleteConflict`, `SetNowMotion`, `GetAbsolutePosition`, `MoveHumanoid`;
  `Sound`/`InsertConflict` are parked NON_MATCHING (sub-C regalloc ties). Next
  high-lev: `AdtMessageBox` (87), `GetConflictResult` (conflict trio), `SoundEx`.
- **Remaining item family**: the ~16 large `ProcItem*` (784–2468B, Fable tier)
  and the 5272B `ReqItemUse` dispatcher.

## Tooling backlog (recurring friction → build these)

- **A register-preference/tie diagnoser** — BUILT: `tools/regalloc.py <Name>`.
  Parses cc1 `-dg` into the pseudo→hard-reg map, the values live across calls
  (forced callee-saved — the pressure), and the copy-chains that bias coloring.
  The tell that you're in tie territory (when to reach for it): `autorules`
  reports no win AND a bounded permuter run never beats the base score. Run
  `regalloc.py` then break the copy-chain / shorten the live range it points at,
  instead of blind permuting. (Open v2: diff our greg allocation against the
  target asm's registers to auto-flag the divergent value.)
- **A GTE-opcode → `.word` pass** (NOT built — needs a build-pipeline + policy
  decision, so parked for the owner). `as` can't assemble PS1 GTE command
  opcodes, so splat's per-function split of any renderer helper (the ~5
  `FUN_8005dxxx` `DrawTMD` handlers, `SetDepthQ`, neighbors) won't assemble —
  the whole GTE-using region is un-splittable. The transform itself is trivial
  and byte-exact: rewrite each GTE mnemonic line to `.word 0x…` from splat's own
  `/* … WORD */` comment (like maspsx's other normalizations); the open part is
  WHERE it runs (post-splat on the nonmatchings `.s`, or a maspsx addition) and
  that MATCHING the region additionally needs the inline-asm/register-pinned
  policy (non-ABI calling convention) — so do both together. See the cookbook's
  Toolchain-gotchas GTE entry.
