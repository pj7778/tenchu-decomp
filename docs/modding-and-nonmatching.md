# Non-matching builds: modding & debug

You don't always want a byte-match — modifying behaviour, adding debug output,
cheats, etc. This documents what works today and how to make deviations run.

## Choose the build contract

The default and relink commands have deliberately different jobs:

```console
$ ./Build             # reference layout/matching branches; same-size edits only
$ ./Build mod         # patch selected same-slot sources into main_mod.exe
$ ./Build relink      # normal GNU-ld layout; functions/data/BSS may move
$ ./Build check-relink # structural audit plus full +0x10004 growth proof
$ ./Build shiftability-report # current blocker queue and composed proofs
```

`./Build check` is only for verifying that the reference decomp still matches
retail. It is not the size-changing mod gate. For a normal source edit, build
`main_relink.exe` and launch it with `run-relink` or package it with
`iso-relink`.

## What works: same-size edits (verified)

An edit that keeps the function the **same size** (same instruction count)
produces a valid, runnable binary. Verified: changing `arg0 >> 4` to `arg0 >> 5`
in `get_held_buttons` yields a binary that is **byte-identical except the one
changed instruction** — same total size, PS-EXE header untouched. Everything
else stays at its original address, so all the game's pointers (symbolic and raw)
are still correct.

Same-size covers a lot: changing constants/immediates, swapping a branch
condition, changing which register/field is used, reordering independent ops,
tweaking arithmetic. Prefer these when you want a drop-in behaviour change.

## Why size changes break the reference lane

Adding or removing instructions (e.g. a `printf` debug line, an extra call)
**changes the function's size**. Verified: adding a second call to
`get_held_buttons` grew the binary by 8 bytes and made ~68% of the file differ —
because everything laid out **after** the edited function shifts down by 8.

The reference build may still link, but that artifact is **not the right
runtime contract** for a size change:

- The linker script places sections **sequentially** from `0x80011000`, so a
  function that grows pushes every later function and data block down.
- The reference data is a mix of symbolic directives and retail raw bytes, and
  its symbol scripts intentionally retain fixed retail assignments.
- When code shifts, the symbolic references move with it but the raw/fixed ones
  don't. The two disagree → the binary is internally inconsistent → it crashes.
- The PS-EXE header's `.text` size (`0x00087000`, hardcoded in the generated
  `header.s`) also no longer matches the grown image.

In short: the exact reference lane can absorb *substitutions* but is not the
normal-link lane for *insertions*.

## Existing convenience lane: `./Build mod` — patch in place

Non-matching behaviour changes (a decompiled function edited however you like) are
handled by **overwriting the function in place**, wired in as the `mod` target:

```console
$ # put your modified function in src/mod/main.exe/<fn>.c (filename == fn)
$ ./Build mod        # -> .shake/build/tenchu/main_mod.exe
mkmod: hooking ProcItemKusuri
  ProcItemKusuri: 1376/1432 bytes -> patched in place @ 0x80040500
mkmod: wrote .shake/build/tenchu/main_mod.exe (555008 bytes, same size as main.exe …)
```

How it works (`tools/mkmod.py`): it starts from the byte-matching `main.exe`, then
for each `src/mod/main.exe/<fn>.c`:

1. compiles it with the normal pipeline (`cpp | cc1 -G8 | maspsx | as`);
2. links it at the function's **original address**, resolving the game's other
   symbols from `main.exe.elf`;
3. overwrites that function's bytes in `main.exe` with the result.

The function must **fit in its original slot** (its address → the next symbol). Since
nothing moves, `main_mod.exe` is byte-identical to `main.exe` except that function —
same size, PS-EXE header untouched — so the disc rebuild keeps forced LBAs and it runs
on any emulator or real hardware. `src/main.exe/` (the matching decomp) is untouched;
mods live only in `src/mod/main.exe/`.

This target is intentionally in-place. It remains useful for a minimal
byte-faithful disc diff, but it is not the architecture for size-changing edits and it does
not use trampolines or a hidden mod region. A genuine relink can move code,
loaded data, BSS, and linker-derived boundaries within the executable's RAM
budget.

**If it doesn't fit**, `./Build mod` aborts with the overage, e.g.:

```
mkmod: ProcItemKusuri compiled to 1440 bytes but its slot (…) is only 1432 — over by 8.
Trim it (drop debug logging / simplify) so it fits in place …
```

Trim the function — drop debug/log calls, simplify Ghidra-isms — until it fits. (The
worked example `ProcItemKusuri.c` drops the original's `AdtMessageBox("item dispose
fail…")` diagnostic, which is never hit in normal play, to make room.)

## Size-changing normal relink

The static normal-link path is implemented, and there are two equivalent ways
to change a function:

- **Override lane (keeps `./Build check` green).** Copy the function's file to
  `src/mod-relink/main.exe/<Name>.c` and edit the copy. Only the normal relink
  reads that directory: the file is compiled by the identical
  `cpp | cc1-281 | maspsx | as` pipeline and its object replaces the original
  at the original position in the link order, so the function grows or
  shrinks in place while the matched tree and the byte-identical reference
  build stay pristine. A misspelled name fails script generation with
  "override target … is not a linker input"; `vinit`/`valloc` are rejected
  because their normal-lane objects carry the reviewed allocator relocation
  transform (change `src/main.exe/ram_layout.h` policy instead).
- **In-place edit.** Edit `src/main.exe/<Name>.c` directly. Same result in the
  relink lane, but `./Build check` is red until you revert, since the exact
  lane compiles the same file.

Brand-new translation units (helpers, new subsystems) go under
`src/main.exe/reloc/` in both cases. Then run:

```console
$ ./Build check-relink
$ ./Build run-relink       # fast direct MAIN.EXE launch
$ ./Build iso-relink       # package the actual normal-link executable
$ ./Build run-iso-relink   # full SLPS/MENU/MAIN boot
```

To verify a mod's behavior mechanically, `tools/pcsx_smoke.py` accepts
`--watch-counter SYMBOL` (u32 must be nonzero and increasing once the main
loop runs) and `--watch-equals SYMBOL=VALUE` (u32 must hold VALUE), with the
addresses resolved from the relinked ELF. The worked end-to-end example — a
grown `PadProc` calling a new TU, booted through the full disc chain — is in
[relocatable-build.md](relocatable-build.md#real-grown-function-edit-proof).

The normal lane retains the pinned compiler's ordinary output sections for
existing `*.c.o` game objects, the two transformed allocator `.o` inputs, and
new helper files. Those allocator objects come from the same C source as the
matching lane; only their generated address pairs are made symbolic. The
retained sections include small and large initialized/tentative globals,
statics, const/float/double data,
`.sdata`/`.sbss`/`.scommon`, `.bss.*`, and GNU `COMMON`; gp-small objects are
kept within signed GPREL16 reach. “Whatever C” is scoped to those normal
toolchain sections and available PS1 RAM. A custom allocatable section causes
an explicit orphan-section link failure instead of being silently discarded;
arbitrary section attributes and unlimited data are not supported.

`./Build relink` also audits the exact map-loaded input objects immediately
after `ld`. Numeric casts or canonical assembly that hard-code a movable MAIN
call, address pair, or aligned data pointer fail unless the corresponding MIPS
relocation exists; unowned allocatable sections fail even when empty.
`check-relink` reruns this gate and adds the final-image and growth audits. The
input scan is intentionally heuristic for arbitrary register arithmetic and
unaligned opaque packed data, whose current known cases are covered by the
reviewed manifest and shifted growth proof. See the
[exact coverage](relocatable-build.md#mandatory-input-object-relocation-audit).

The composed linker owns all 555 game inputs, the complete CRT/SDK stream,
initialized data, `_gp`, BSS, allocator boundaries, and the PS-X header. The
reviewed data transform supplies 208 `R_MIPS_32` pointer records. The widened
audit reports zero movable absolute symbols, literal jumps, adjacent address
pairs, or data pointers.

`check-relink` also performs a real GNU-ld link with `0x10004` bytes inserted
after `main.c.o`. That proof checks 7,706 owned symbols, all 208 loaded pointers,
HI16 carry behavior, BSS movement, dynamic allocator shrinkage, and a changed
PS-X entry/load size. The linker chose PC `0x80070260` and `t_size=0x97000` for
the grown fixture; no per-function slot, cave, trampoline, or fixed downstream
address is involved. Its extension list mirrors the normal link's recursive
user/generated source union, so nested `src/main.exe/reloc/` helpers participate
in the same proof.

Run `./Build shiftability-report` when deciding what to fix next. A BLOCKER is
a failed relocation, ownership, or layout proof. DEBT means the normal link
already uses a safe symbolic object but the byte-matching and normal source
shapes have not converged; CONTRACT and POLICY entries are intentional
boundaries, not stale pointers. Fixed contracts and configurable RAM-budget
values are centralized in `src/main.exe/ram_layout.h`. `HEAP_START` itself is
linker-derived as BSS end plus four, so it is intentionally not another numeric
constant. Section-owned globals are deliberately not offsets from a numeric
“game globals base”: ordinary source must name their linker symbols so they
follow layout changes.

The current controlled growth artifact also passes the bounded PCSX-Redux
runtime probe in both modes: direct `-loadexe` and an auto-LBA repack through
`SLPS_019.01 → MENU.EXE → MAIN.EXE`. The harness reached entry `0x80070260`,
ELF-derived `main` at `0x800162a4`, moved `PadProc` at `0x8002adac`, and later
VSyncs without a first-chance exception. The same repacked image also reached
relocated `OPEN06.STR` decode and `STAGES.XA` setup/callback checkpoints. This
establishes representative media paths, not complete playback, physical XA
audio output, every gameplay path, or every arbitrary edit. Growth remains
bounded by the PS1 RAM map, the fixed cross-executable handoff,
allocator/stack space, and MIPS relocation ranges. See
[relocatable-build.md](relocatable-build.md) and
[the exact smoke commands](building-an-iso.md#automated-grown-image-smoke).

## Debugger symbols in PCSX-Redux

Every `./Build run*` launcher passes a generated `-dofile` that
`PCSX.insertSymbol()`s the launched artifact's complete symbol table, so the
debugger's disassembly, breakpoints, and call stacks are named out of the
box. The names come from the artifact's own ELF
(`<artifact>.symbols.lua` beside it, built by `tools/pcsx_symbols.py`), so
the exact, in-place-mod, and relink layouts each get their own correct
addresses — including moved symbols in grown relink images. `main_mod.exe`
is patched in place and shares `main.exe`'s symbols. For the scaffolded
sibling executables, `tools/pcsx_symbols.py --tsv
config/functions.menu.exe.tsv` produces a loader you can `-dofile` manually
when debugging MENU.EXE (loading two executables' symbol sets at once is
deliberately not automatic: they share the same RAM addresses).

That same address→name map can also be pushed to an **already-running**
instance over its web server (enable it with `-webserver`, default port
8080): `POST /api/v1/assembly/symbols?function=upload` with a body of
`ADDRESS NAME` lines (hex address, space-separated), or `?function=reset` to
clear. It writes the same `m_symbols` map as the Lua loader, so it is an
alternative for live updates without relaunching; the `-dofile` path is what
the launchers use because it needs no server or port.

## Typed Debugger: data types and typed function arguments

The Typed Debugger (Debug → Typed Debugger) shows memory through recovered
struct layouts and typed function arguments. It has its own import format,
separate from the symbol map above, and — unlike the symbol map — **no Lua or
web-server hook**, so it is imported through its two file dialogs (once per
session). The build keeps the two files fresh next to each artifact and the
`run*` launcher prints their paths:

- `<artifact>.redux_data_types.txt` — recovered struct layouts from
  `reference/psxsym-types.h`, with exact per-field sizes (consecutive offset
  deltas). Layout-independent.
- `<artifact>.redux_funcs.txt` — recovered prototypes from
  `reference/psxsym-protos.h`, addressed from the launched ELF, so the
  addresses match the running layout.

`tools/redux_typed_debugger.py` generates them; it normalises types to the
widget's resolver rules (bare struct names so nesting resolves, `Base *`
pointers, single-token primitives). In the widget, click **Import data
types** then **Import functions** and pick those two files.

## Running a modified exe

Both mod launchers use the same-size `main_mod.exe`, so both are byte-faithful except
your function (see [building-an-iso.md](building-an-iso.md)):

- `./Build run-mod` — `-loadexe main_mod.exe` over the original disc. Fast, but boots
  `MAIN.EXE` directly (skips `SLPS→MENU`), so some game state is under-initialised.
- `./Build run-iso-mod` — **faithful**: repacks the disc with `main_mod.exe` (forced
  LBAs, streamed cutscenes intact) and runs the full `SLPS→MENU→MAIN` boot. Use this
  to actually play a mod.

For a size-changing normal link, use `run-relink` for the fast direct launch and
`run-iso-relink` for the full launcher/media path. Those commands consume
`main_relink.exe`, not the fixed-slot mod artifact. For a bounded automated
check, point `tools/pcsx_smoke.py` at that executable and its ELF; add
`--repack` to exercise the launcher/menu path. A real mod should still exercise
its changed behavior and relevant STR/XA content rather than treating the boot
smoke as comprehensive coverage.
