# Matching cookbook — cc1 2.8.1 source idioms that byte-match

What we've learned, function by function, about how the original source must
be *shaped* for our exact compiler (the nix-pinned canonical decompals
`gcc-2.8.1-psx` cc1, verified equivalent to the real Sony `CC1PSX.EXE` — see
[toolchain.md](toolchain.md)) to reproduce the original bytes. Every rule
below was verified against the original binary; the jump.c/fold-const.c ones
were confirmed by reading the actual GCC 2.8.1 sources
(`mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.8.1.tar.gz`).

Worked examples, in increasing difficulty:
[`Think1sleep.c`](../src/main.exe/Think1sleep.c),
[`GetRealPad.c`](../src/main.exe/GetRealPad.c),
[`ProcItemManebue.c`](../src/main.exe/ProcItemManebue.c),
[`ProcItemKusuri.c`](../src/main.exe/ProcItemKusuri.c) (1432 bytes — the most
idioms in one place; read its header comment).

## The workflow

```console
$ tools/reverse.py <Name> --ghidra-export .shake/ghidra-export
      # splits the function, seeds src/main.exe/<Name>.c with Ghidra's C,
      # verifies ./Build check stays green (INCLUDE_ASM stub)
$ # write a first draft from the Ghidra comment + this cookbook, then loop:
$ tools/matchdiff.py <Name>
      # ./Build + byte-compare the function window vs the original;
      # prints differing instructions side by side. Iterate until MATCH,
$ ./Build check      # then confirm the whole image
```

## Iteration protocol

The ordered triage — fix categories in THIS order, re-running
`tools/matchdiff.py <Name>` after every source change:

1. **Length first.** If your function assembles to a different instruction
   count (matchdiff's whole-image number explodes), the *structure* is wrong —
   dispatch shape, loop shape, missing/extra temps, tail merging. Fix before
   anything else; operand diffs are meaningless while the length is off.
2. **Wrong/missing/reordered instructions next.** Map each to a cookbook rule
   (switch vs ladder, while(1)+break, fold reassociation, temps-vs-inline,
   buffer casts, statement order). `tools/findsimilar.py <Name>` names the
   matched functions most like yours — read their source and header notes
   first; imitate the nearest one.
3. **Register-only differences last.** They usually fall out of 1–2. The
   levers, in order: statement/assignment position (a one-line move can flip
   allocation priorities and delay-slot fills), declaration of temps, and
   finally `tools/permute.py <Name>` for pure allocation ties.
4. Don't trust the byte count alone — read the diff. A change can improve the
   count while shifting registers globally (worse), or vice versa.
5. **Attempt cap.** If ~10 meaningful source changes haven't reduced the diff,
   stop: restore the INCLUDE_ASM stub, keep your best attempt in the file as a
   comment or note `/* CURRENT(N): best attempt, see notes */`, commit nothing
   red, and record what blocked you. decomp.me (psyq4.3 preset) arbitrates
   "is this expressible at all".
6. **On MATCH:** `./Build check`, add the matching-notes header, promote any
   NEW reusable rule to this cookbook, commit the function + splat.yaml
   together.

## Picking targets

`tools/findsimilar.py --targets` ranks every unmatched function by assembly
similarity to the matched corpus (best-first, smallest-first) — the top
entries are near-clones of things we've already solved and make good next
targets. Prefer functions from an original TU we've already touched (shared
headers like item.h and the gp-extern lists already exist for those). Batch
work: one function per matcher agent (.claude/agents/matcher.md), and commit
only on a green `./Build check`.

### coddog (similarity at scale)

[coddog](https://github.com/ethteck/coddog) complements findsimilar.
`tools/coddog` builds it on first use (needs network + registry nixpkgs — the
flake's rust is too old); it reads `decomp.yaml`, whose input ELF is
synthesized by `tools/coddog-elf.py` from the original bytes + the Ghidra
function table (our real ELF/map aren't consumable: NOTYPE size-0 symbols, no
vrom). **Regenerate after the Ghidra export changes or after new matches**
(it also refreshes the stems dir that makes the "(decompiled)" tag truthful):

```console
$ tools/coddog-elf.py
$ tools/coddog cluster -m 4        # identical-function families: match one,
                                   #   apply to the whole cluster (e.g.
                                   #   dmyGsPrstF3NL ×108, ReqItemManebue ×5)
$ tools/coddog submatch <Name> 20  # who shares a ≥20-insn chunk with <Name> —
                                   #   the "stuck on this idiom" tool (found a
                                   #   79-insn run shared by ProcItemKusuri
                                   #   and ProcSightShot)
$ tools/coddog match <Name> -t 0.5 # similar whole functions; good for BIG
                                   #   functions, noisy under ~300 bytes — use
                                   #   findsimilar for small ones
```

Treat the differing-byte count as a score to drive down (matchdiff also
reports the whole-image count: if your function assembles to a different
LENGTH, every object after it shifts and even data symbols drift — fix the
instruction count before chasing operand diffs); each structured diff
(wrong register class, wrong block order, wrong instruction) maps to one of
the rules below. When a residual diff resists source-shaping, decomp.me with
the `psyq4.3` preset arbitrates "is this expressible at all" (it runs the real
Sony compiler; our cc1 is equivalent to it — if it can't, restructure; if it
can, keep hunting). `tools/permute.py` (decomp-permuter) cracks pure
register-allocation ties.

**Trust the assembly over Ghidra's statement order.** Ghidra's decompiler
reorders memory operations and normalizes conditions freely; the asm's store
order and branch polarity are the source's. Ghidra's *types* however are
gold — match its return/variable types exactly (`Think1sleep` needed
`short`/`ushort` accumulators, not `s32`).

## Dispatch

- A mode-dispatcher that **reloads its variable** (two `lbu` of the same
  field) and compares **signed** (`slti`) is a real **`switch`**: cc1's
  `expand_case` emits a balanced compare tree over a *fresh* index load. An
  if/goto-ladder CSEs the load into one `lbu` and compares small unsigned
  types with `sltiu`. Case bodies are laid out in source order.
- A preceding test that keeps its constant in a **callee-saved register**
  across calls (`li $s4, 0xFF` + later `sb $s4`) is a local variable
  (`u8 ff = 0xff;`) also used by a later store. A path where the same value is
  materialized fresh (`li $v1, 0xFF`) uses a literal there — the register got
  reused for something else in between.
- Branch-if-equal *into* a physically-later block with the fallthrough being
  the other body usually means the source condition was the **opposite
  polarity** of Ghidra's rendering (`if (0xe < n) {...} else {...}` vs
  Ghidra's `if (n < 0xf)` with swapped bodies).
- **Don't reuse the switch variable inside case bodies across calls**: a
  dispatch-only variable dies at the case tree and lives in a caller-saved
  reg (`move $v1,$v0` after the call that produced it). Assigning a later
  call result to the *same* variable inside a case body extends one pseudo's
  life across calls → it's promoted to a callee-saved reg, adding a prologue
  save and shifting the whole function by one instruction. Use a separate
  case-local variable (DoInfoViewProc: `sel` dispatches, the helpers' `n`
  takes the sub-menu results in $s0).
- **A tests-then-bodies ladder for two values is a nested `switch`**:
  `beqz $sN → bodyA; li $v0,1; beq $sN,$v0 → bodyB; j end` with both bodies
  laid out after the tests is `switch (n) { case 0: ...; case 1: ...; }`.
  An `if (n==0) ... else if (n==1)` chain puts the first body on the
  fallthrough path instead — and because that keeps the second body in the
  same extended basic block as the `li 1` compare, cse reuses $v0 for a later
  constant-1 argument (`move $a2,$v0`); the switch's branch-taken bodies get
  a fresh `li $a2,1` like the original (cse tables don't follow the taken
  edge).

## Loops

- `for (init; cond; inc)` and `while (cond)` expand with a jump to a
  bottom test; jump.c's `duplicate_loop_exit_test` (fires only when
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` is immediately followed by a simplejump) then copies
  the exit test to the entry, where a provable initial value constant-folds it
  away → **bottom-test do-while shape**.
- **`while (1) { if (!(cond)) break; ...; i++; }`** keeps the original's
  **top-test + unconditional back-jump** shape (first insn after the loop
  note is a condjump → no duplication) *and* still gets loop.c's invariant
  hoisting (address pseudos, division magic constants moved to the preheader).
- A hand-rolled `label: if (...) goto...` loop also keeps the top test but
  **loses hoisting** (no loop notes → loop.c skips it): magic divisors and
  invariant addresses get rematerialized per iteration. Wrong.
- **No combined address bases + no rotated tests ⇒ goto loops.** Real
  for/while/do-while get loop.c strength reduction (extra induction pseudos
  folding several field offsets, e.g. base+2/base+6) and jump.c rotation (a
  break test migrating to the bottom with a compensation decrement). A
  hand-rolled `label: ... if (cond) goto label;` keeps one cursor with the
  original displacements and a top test + conditional back-jump
  (GetAreaMapLevel's node walk). Corollary: a TU that divides by a variable
  needs maspsx `--expand-div` for ASPSX's break 7/break 6 guards — per-file,
  via the `extra` list next to maspsxGpExterns in Build.hs (mirrored in
  permute.py MASPSX_EXTRA).
- An induction variable zeroed in a **branch delay slot** of the dispatch
  (`move $s1, $zero` under the `beq`) is just `i = 0;` as the first statement
  of the case body — reorg hoists the target block's head insn into the delay
  slot and retargets the branch.
- **A wrap-around search loop with its increment in the backjump's delay slot
  and an inverse-compensation on the fallthrough exit** is a plain do-while
  with the increment as the FIRST body statement:
  `i = CURR; cur = i; do { i--; if (i < 0) i = 0x19; } while (item[i] == 0 &&
  i != cur);` — reorg steals the top-of-loop `i--` into the conditional
  backjump's slot, retargets the branch to the wrap check, and patches the
  fallthrough exit with `addiu +1` (the entry path falls into the original
  loop top, executing the first decrement for free). Writing the increment
  at the loop *bottom* (`for(;;){...; i--;}`) emits `beq → exit; nop; j top`
  instead — one wasted slot. Load into `i` first then copy to `cur`
  (`i = CURR; cur = i;`) so the lh lands in i's register and the copy is
  `move cur,i`, matching the original operand order (DoInfoViewProc).

## Expressions

- **fold reassociation** (fold-const.c `associate`/`split_tree`): any
  `A - C + B` or `A + (B - C)` gets its constant migrated between operands.
  `t - 500 + rand() % 1000` reassociates the *wrong* way (constant lands on
  the remainder). Write **`t + (rand() % 1000 - 500)`** — fold canonicalizes
  it into the original's `(t - 500) + rem`. Semantically that's also the
  natural "position + centered jitter".
- Keep calls **inline in expressions**: `x = rand() % 200 - 100;` uses `$v0`
  straight from the call; a temp (`r = rand(); x = r % ...`) inserts a
  `move`. cc1 evaluates the call operand of a binary expression first, so an
  inline call still executes before the other operand's loads.
- `%` by a constant compiles to the magic-multiply sequence (`mult`, `mfhi`,
  shift/add chains) — automatic from natural `%`; the *same* magic constant
  shared by several `%`s in range gets CSE'd into one callee-saved register.
- Unsigned halfword loads (`lhu`) mean the field is `u16` even when a
  neighbouring field is `s16` (`life` is `s16`@0x8, `lifemax` is `u16`@0xA).
  Different original TUs can disagree about the same field: the item TU
  `lhu`'s lifemax (u16) but the info-view TU `lh`'s it — keep the shared
  header's proven type and cast at the divergent use
  (`(s16)CamState.Owner->lifemax`, DoInfoViewProc's PutLifeBar call).
- Byte-sized call arguments loaded with `lbu` and no masking are plain `u8`
  struct fields passed directly.
- **A constant stored to both a narrow field and a full-word field must be a
  shared int variable**: cc1 gives the literal in `s16_field = 8;` an HImode
  pseudo and a later `s32_field = 8;` a separate SImode one — two `li`s, one
  instruction too long. `m = 8; ... p->pad = m; ... q->mode = m;` yields the
  original's single `li` in one register (the `sh` reads its low part). The
  tell: the same small constant materialized twice, once feeding `sh`, once
  `sw` (ProcItemDrop's conflict-insert path).
- A two-statement remainder temp (`x = rand(); x = x % 200;`) is provable
  from the asm: the `mult`/`subu` operate **in place on the moved call
  result's register** ($sN) — inline `rand() % 200` computes on `$v0`.
- **A narrowing store fed through a temp forces the full-word load**:
  `x = p->end.vx; pp->vx = x;` gives the original's `lw` + `sh`, while the
  inline `pp->vx = p->end.vx;` lets the canonical cc1 emit a truncating `lhu`
  of the low half. Loads batched before a run of stores (`lw`×3 then `sh`×3)
  mean the values went through source temps.

## Stack objects

- When Ghidra shows **overlapping stack locals** (its `local_40`-style merged
  buffer), the original really used **one `u8 buf[N]` + casts**
  (`(PARAM_ITEM_USE *)buf`, `*(VECTOR *)(buf + 0x10)`, ...). cc1 2.8 does
  **not** share stack slots between sibling scopes, so distinct scoped locals
  can't reproduce the overlap.
- The **cast type's alignment drives copy code**: `*(VECTOR *)a =
  *(VECTOR *)b` is a word block move (4×`lw`+4×`sw`, `$t2/$t3/$t4/$t1`
  rotation; a 0x50-byte struct assignment becomes the 16-bytes-per-iteration
  copy loop), while `*(SVECTOR *)a = *(SVECTOR *)b` (align 2) is `lwl/lwr` +
  `swl/swr` pairs.
- Write grouped stores **through the same base expression** a later copy
  reads (`((s32 *)(buf + 0x10))[n] = ...;` rather than
  `*(s32 *)(buf + 0x18) = ...;`): with distinct address pseudos the scheduler
  loses the store→copy dependence and interleaves the copy into the divide
  latency (differently from the original).
- **Overlapping big frame buffers whose addresses rematerialize at every
  call are INLINED STATIC HELPERS, not locals** (DoInfoViewProc's debug
  menus). Mechanics, all three observable in the bytes:
  (1) a frame-address argument (`&local` / decayed array, any spelling) is
  forced into a pseudo by calls.c `precompute_register_parameters` whenever
  its offset from the frame base is nonzero (the value is `(plus vreg c)`,
  not a REG) — and two same-valued forced pseudos in one extended basic
  block get cse'd into a single callee-saved register (`addiu $s0,$sp,N` +
  `move $a1,$s0` twice), costing an extra prologue save. A helper's OWN
  first local sits at inlined-frame offset 0, so its address is the bare
  remapped register → every call re-materializes `addiu $a1,$sp,N` like the
  original. (2) inline expansion allocates the helper frame as a TEMP SLOT,
  freed at the call statement's end: the next inlined helper's frame REUSES
  it if it fits (cc1 never overlaps ordinary sibling-scope locals — verified
  again by probe). DoInfoViewProc: item menu 0xC8 @ sp+0x78; the next
  helper's 0x40 layout+confirm pair reuses 0x78/0xA0; the 0xF8 effect menu
  doesn't fit the freed slot and lands fresh at 0x140; caller's own `mm`
  local sits below at 0x20. Frame = args 0x20 + 0x58 + 0xC8 + 0xF8 + saves
  = 0x248, byte-exact. The tell to look for: same sp offset written by two
  unrelated struct copies + `addiu $a1,$sp,N` repeated per call + a frame
  smaller than the sum of the visible buffers.

## Register allocation steering

- **Source statement order is the main regalloc lever.** Storing
  register-held values first (`prm.type = ty; prm.user = own;`) before
  memory-chain stores frees their registers for later constants — in
  ProcItemKusuri that one swap released `$s0` for the division magic and
  collapsed a whole extra callee-saved register out of the prologue.
- For a guarded indirect call, null-check through a variable but **call
  through the field**: `ppu = item->proc; if (ppu == 0) return; ...
  item->proc(item);` — cse reuses the loaded value and allocation lands in
  `$v0`; calling through `ppu` flips it to `$v1`.
- Cached pointers that live in `$s`-registers across calls
  (`p = &item->param;`) are real source temporaries — indexing the base
  struct directly doesn't allocate the register (see ProcItemManebue).
- **A `do { ... } while (0);` wrapper is a regalloc lever**: the degenerate
  loop generates no code, but its loop notes make flow.c count every ref
  inside at loop_depth 2, doubling those pseudos' priority in global-alloc.
  When the callee-saved assignment is permuted relative to the target and
  statement-level tweaks can't fix it, wrapping the body (after parameter
  setup, before the final return) re-weights the whole interior at once
  (GetAreaMapLevel: flipped four s-registers in one move; GetRealPad's old
  wrapper was the same mechanism).
- **Reused parameters vs fresh locals show in the prologue**: `move $s5,$a1`
  + later arithmetic on $s5 means the original overwrote the parameter
  (`x = x / 10;`) — the param pseudo gets a callee-saved home. A fresh local
  computes straight into the s-register with no entry move.
- **Assignment position around a branch is a double lever** (ReqItemDrop):
  `pp = ...;` placed *before* `if (it == 0) return 0;` lets reorg fill the
  `beqz` delay slot with its `addiu` (instead of collapsing the return-0
  block into the slot) *and* lengthens pp's live range, demoting its
  allocation priority so the function argument keeps `$s1`. One statement
  move fixed a register swap, a missing block, and two missing instructions.
- A base-address pseudo appearing mid-sequence (`addiu $a0, $s1, 8` between
  two accesses) is a temp assigned between the statements:
  `t[0] = p->start.vx; st = &p->start; t[1] = st->vy; ...`.
- The reverse also holds: **cc1 does not fold away a pointer temp to a frame
  object**. `PARAM_ITEM_USE *prm = (PARAM_ITEM_USE *)buf;` allocates a
  callee-saved register for the address (frame grows, prologue shifts), and a
  `VECTOR *w = (VECTOR *)(buf + 0x10);` temp inside a loop reshuffles the
  induction/invariant registers. When the target *rematerializes* a frame
  address (`addiu $a0, $sp, 0x10` appearing repeatedly), the original wrote
  the cast at every use — repeated `((T *)buf)->field` casts, however ugly,
  are the source's real shape. `sizeof(T)` in the memsets is free
  (compile-time constant) and matches.

## Shared tails

- An identical dispose/cleanup sequence reached from two paths with a `j`
  into the middle of one copy is **the code written out twice** in source —
  GCC's cross-jump pass merges the common suffix (from the `jalr` backwards;
  the differing prefixes, e.g. two different `mode = 0xff` stores, stay
  separate). A shared `goto` label merges *more* than the original (loses the
  duplicated call-site setup) — don't.

- **Multiple `return CONST;` statements cross-jump unpredictably; a labeled
  return body pins them**: write the constant return once, label INSIDE the
  last guarding if (`if (...) { ret_min: return 0x80000000; }`), `goto
  ret_min;` elsewhere — one fallthrough-entered body whose insns reorg steals
  into the other branches' delay slots.
- A conditional branch that lands PAST a load at its target block is reorg's
  redundant-insn elimination (the branch path already has the value): both
  source paths simply read the same variable — no restructuring needed.

## gp vs absolute globals (item-TU vs think-TU)

ASPSX gp-addresses only symbols **defined in the TU being assembled**;
externs are always absolute (`lui $at`/dest-reg expansion of the one-line
macro). Our per-file `maspsxGpExterns` list in `Build.hs` encodes "smalls the
original TU defined". Full story + evidence in
[toolchain.md](toolchain.md#gp-globals-making-small-globals-byte-match-solved--per-tu-opt-in).
Practical rule: a new function needing `$gp` for a symbol → add
`--gp-extern` for it in that file's list (and mirror in
`tools/permute.py` `GP_EXTERNS`); needing absolute → declare it a plain small
extern and keep the file off the list.

## Toolchain gotchas

- `-fdollars-in-identifiers` is required for anything including
  `reference/ghidra_types.h` (Ghidra `$`-names); the mod pipeline passes it.
- The canonical cc1 correctly reads the **low** halfword for
  `(short) = (int)` truncation; if you see a high-half `lhu` (offset+2),
  something reintroduced the old non-canonical binary.
