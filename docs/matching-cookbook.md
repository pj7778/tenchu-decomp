# Matching cookbook — cc1 2.8.1 source idioms that byte-match

What we've learned, function by function, about how the original source must
be *shaped* for our exact compiler (the nix-pinned canonical decompals
`gcc-2.8.1-psx` cc1, verified equivalent to the real Sony `CC1PSX.EXE` — see
[toolchain.md](toolchain.md)) to reproduce the original bytes. Every rule
below was verified against the original binary; the jump.c/fold-const.c ones
were confirmed by reading the actual GCC 2.8.1 sources
(`mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.8.1.tar.gz`).

Worked examples, in increasing difficulty:
[`Think1sleep.c`](../src/main.exe/Think1sleep.c),
[`GetRealPad.c`](../src/main.exe/GetRealPad.c),
[`ProcItemManebue.c`](../src/main.exe/ProcItemManebue.c),
[`ProcItemKusuri.c`](../src/main.exe/ProcItemKusuri.c) (1432 bytes — the most
idioms in one place; read its header comment).

## Start from the original source's own facts

Before drafting anything, look up what the authors actually wrote. The Japanese
demo's `PSX.SYM` (see [psx-sym.md](psx-sym.md)) preserves, for 442 of the game's
functions, the **prototype with parameter names**, the **source file and line**, and
**every local variable** — name, type, and whether the compiler kept it in a register
or on the stack. `tools/matcher-prompt.py <Name>` prints all of it, plus the globals
the function touches with their original declarations.

```
- Original prototype: short DrawSprite(struct Sprite3D *sprt);   /* 3DCTRL.C:593 */
- The original locals (8):
    param $s1     struct Sprite3D * sprt
    stack sp+16   struct MATRIX mat
    reg   $s1     struct ModelType * objp
    stack sp+48   short [2] rxy
- Globals it touches:  extern struct GsOT *OTablePt;   /* 0x80097eb0 */
```

Three things this buys you:

- **The local count and types are often the single biggest lever on cc1's codegen.**
  Use the demo list, in order, as the first draft—not as a retail specification.
  Retail sometimes changed the helper/API and therefore the aggregate type itself:
  `AntiWall` moved from `ApplyMatrixSV`/`SVECTOR` outputs to
  `ApplyRotMatrix`/`VECTOR`. Target access widths and the retail callee ABI override
  the demo locals whenever they disagree.
- **The prototype is not a guess.** `reference/psxsym-protos.h` beats anything Ghidra
  or m2c infers. `reference/psxsym-globals.h` beats inventing a layout for `D_800BC108`
  — the original called it `struct ConflictObjectType ConflictObject[64]`.
- **TU-mates are contiguous.** `reference/psxsym-tu-map.tsv` tells you which functions
  shared a `.c` file, which pins rodata pooling and the `%gp` vs absolute choice
  (see [gp vs absolute globals](#gp-vs-absolute-globals-item-tu-vs-think-tu)).

Caveats worth internalising: the layouts are from an **earlier build**, so verify a
field offset with `tools/access.py` before relying on it; a local name repeated inside
one function is a nested-block scope, not a duplicate; and `psxsym-types.h`'s
`.NNNfake` tags were per-TU, so a struct named after one is only meaningful with its
file.

These same facts are stamped into the top of each `src/main.exe/*.c` as a
`BEGIN PSX.SYM` block (`tools/symnote.py --write --all`, regenerated in place), so you
see them whether or not you came in through a prompt. 448 of 557 files have one; the
rest are functions `PSX.SYM` never described.

When the committed demo inventory has the same function name, run
`tools/siblingdiff.py <Name> --demo` before drafting. It disassembles both builds,
turns intra-function targets into relative labels, and turns relinked calls/jumps
into shared function names. This made SetFlyWire's earlier 900-byte body a direct
structural oracle for the 984-byte retail function: its distance clamp, midpoint,
and three jitter arms retained their statement shape even though the retail effect
pool scan and `abs` calls changed. Demo register allocation, constants, and layouts
can differ; use the comparison to recover source structure, never as a byte-match
claim.

The demo can also corroborate an otherwise surprising source-identity hypothesis.
If `PSX.SYM` assigns two disjoint roles one local name and the same-named demo and
retail functions repeatedly place those roles in the same hard register, preserve
that reuse before adding allocator ballast. `AddEnemy`'s demo locals `i`, `type`,
and `x` predicted retail's reused `$s4`, `$s7`, and `$s5` ranges; its explicit
caller-saved table-base spills also survived into retail. This is stronger than a
decompiler's fresh SSA names, but retail access widths, CFG, and complete byte diff
still decide the result.

When retail is a composition of preserved demo code plus a family-specific
insertion, run `tools/siblingdiff.py <Name> --compose`. It aligns the target
against the same-named demo and several matched retail siblings at once, gives
the demo first claim on exact runs, fills its gaps from ranked siblings, and
prints both potential source coverage and the remaining unmapped gaps.
ActMOVE mapped most of its 215 instructions to demo ActMOVE while its retail-only
attribute/HangCheck probe matched ActCHASE's already recovered source shape;
composing those blocks with the shared ActCHASE/ActSWIM item tail produced an
exact first C draft. The map is provenance evidence, not permission to splice
machine code: copy the matched C idiom and verify the complete retail function.

If a function is still `FUN_…`, its block carries the recorded candidate name from
`reference/psxsym-candidates.tsv` — a suggestion that was not confident enough to
adopt. Do not rename on it without `tools/callmatch.py --verify`.

The name-recovery tools take function boundaries/sizes from Ghidra's exported TSV,
but overlay current function names from splat's named `c` subsegments by address.
Never classify unresolved names or compare callee fingerprints from the raw Ghidra
names alone: that snapshot is not rewritten when the repository adopts a name, so it
silently turns known callees back into placeholders. Call containment is necessary,
not sufficient; callbacks with the same small set of helpers still require prototype,
constant, and semantic confirmation (the historical, now-corrected `AttackFire`
collision).
`callmatch --verify` mechanically blocks a conservative subset of these as
`AMBIGUOUS` when another full-containment candidate has no more extra named calls
and is at least as close in size; do not override that gate with positional evidence.

Parameter names are already the authors' own wherever they could be adopted
(`tools/symnote.py --params` lists the three still blocked by a name collision with a
local). Match the *locals* to the original list as you draft: that is the lever.

## The workflow

```console
$ tools/reverse.py <Name> --ghidra-export .shake/ghidra-export
      # splits the function, seeds src/main.exe/<Name>.c with Ghidra's C,
      # verifies ./Build check stays green (INCLUDE_ASM stub)
      # the seed carries TWO references: Ghidra's typed-but-normalized C and
      # (appended after the build) m2c's `mipsel-gcc-c` output — m2c has the
      # cleaner control flow / register temps, Ghidra the real types/names.
$ # write a first draft from BOTH references + this cookbook, then loop:
$ tools/matchdiff.py <Name>
      # ./Build + byte-compare the function window vs the original;
      # prints differing instructions side by side. Iterate until MATCH,
$ ./Build check      # then confirm the whole image
```

## Iteration protocol

The ordered triage — fix categories in THIS order, re-running
`tools/matchdiff.py <Name>` after every source change:

1. **Length first.** If your function assembles to a different instruction
   count (matchdiff's whole-image number explodes), the *structure* is wrong —
   dispatch shape, loop shape, missing/extra temps, tail merging. Fix before
   anything else; operand diffs are meaningless while the length is off.
   Exact length is necessary, not sufficient: compare `rtlguide`'s physical
   control-flow inventory too. AddEnemy had an exact-length guided candidate
   only because an identical-arm fence invented a conditional branch absent
   from retail. The structurally honest checkpoint stayed five instructions
   short; accepting the balanced count would have hidden the real allocation
   problem.
2. **Wrong/missing/reordered instructions next.** Map each to a cookbook rule
   (switch vs ladder, while(1)+break, fold reassociation, temps-vs-inline,
   buffer casts, statement order). `tools/findsimilar.py <Name>` names the
   matched functions most like yours — read their source and header notes
   first; imitate the nearest one.
3. **Register-only differences last.** They usually fall out of 1–2. The
   levers, in order: statement/assignment position (a one-line move can flip
   allocation priorities and delay-slot fills), declaration of temps, and
   finally `tools/permute.py <Name>` for pure allocation ties. **A permuter
   winner can carry red herrings alongside the real fix — bisect a multi-diff
   score-0 candidate statement-by-statement and keep only the load-bearing
   change** (bow_shoot_logic's winner touched three things; only the extern
   return-type retype mattered), don't paste it wholesale.
   - **Machine-apply the mechanical rules first.** The moment the draft
     compiles, run `tools/autorules.py <Name>`: it sweeps the *local* rules —
     integer width/sign, `&&` split/merge, single-use temp inline, expression
     polarity, extern-array addressing, and four-field VECTOR aggregate copies
     — and greedily keeps what shrinks the authoritative whole-image byte diff,
     telling you which edit helped. Don't hand-apply these — and if it reports
     no win, the residual is *not* one of them, so move to structure/regalloc
     instead of trying more variants. For a correct-length residual that
     survives that ordinary sweep, run `tools/rtlguide.py <Name>` followed by
     `tools/autorules.py <Name> --guided`. The guide aligns target asm to our
     output, uses cc1 debug NOTE objects to map it back to C lines, selects only
     the owning pass's advanced rules, and keeps a small beam of neutral/slightly
     worse intermediate candidates. The finite build budget is consumed in
     rtlguide's pass-ranked rule order, so dominant-pass allocation/CFG levers
     are tried before generic registry rules. This is how zero-code equivalence
     barriers and cross-jump fences become a bounded mechanical search instead
     of another manual RTL conversation. Guided mode can now fence a contiguous
     range of two-to-four statements (not just one statement) when RTL
     implicates a producer/consumer span. **Reject an autorules "win" that changes a
     PROVEN struct field's ACCESS WIDTH** even when it shrinks the byte count: a
     `u16`→`u8` field retype can narrow a correct `lhu` to `lbu` at another,
     already-matched site — autorules scores *total* diff, not per-site
     correctness, so it reports the net shrink as a win (Think3chase). Target
     asm is also a structural oracle: autorules now retains asmdiff's aligned
     differing-line count and prints `LOCAL-SHAPE REGRESSION` when a byte-count
     win at equal length worsens it. That warning caught FUN_80052ea8's tempting
     signed-`s16` to unsigned-`u16` retype; review the affected hunk instead of
     accepting a length-only win blindly. The raw linked byte count remains the
     authoritative objective, and an exact match is never warned. Target asm
     is also an anti-oracle: `extern-array` refuses any symbol whose target
     access is proven `%gp_rel`, since that symbol categorically must stay on
     the small-data path. (Structural rules that need diff-reading to place —
     loop shape, switch-vs-ladder, union-offset casts — stay manual.)
     The same semantic veto applies to a local whose signedness is recorded by
     PSX.SYM: SetupBG's `short sy` became exact-length and reduced the residual
     when mechanically changed to `u16`, but that contradicts the original
     debug type and was rejected. A better score cannot overrule original type
     evidence.
     Autorules does not rewrite the checked-in C while scoring: candidates live
     under `.shake` and Build.hs consumes them through a per-function source
     override. Only an accepted result is atomically published. TERM/HUP also
     tears down the owned build process group, and Linux parent-death handling
     prevents a dead command frontend from orphaning the search. Still poll a
     yielded command until it returns an exit status; staging makes interruption
     safe, not complete.
4. **A whole-image `./Build check` failure while a function is mid-match is
   EXPECTED, not a regression** — a function of the wrong length shifts every
   later object (even already-matched siblings show huge matchdiff diffs).
   Finish the in-progress function (its own `tools/matchdiff.py <Name>` window
   isolates it); downstream resolves once it reaches the right length. Don't
   bisect.
   - **A byte-residual number from a wrong-length draft is not comparable to an
     exact-length checkpoint.** Current `matchdiff` rejects this as `LENGTH
     MISMATCH`; treat an older STATUS claim based on the padded/carved window as
     stale even if it says only a few bytes differ. PutItemList's 496-byte draft
     claimed eight bytes against a 504-byte target, but had no authoritative
     residual. Recovering the exact 504-byte/126-instruction extent produced a
     valid 51-byte localized residual and raised its normalized fuzzy score from
     72.80 to 94.44 — a real structural improvement despite the larger-looking
     raw number. Once lengths match, the linked byte count is authoritative
     again.
   - **When matching SEVERAL functions in one session, an EARLIER one
     (lower address) being the wrong length makes a LATER one's own
     `matchdiff`/`asmdiff` window compare against the WRONG BYTES, not just
     a bigger diff.** Both tools read the target's address straight from
     `config/symbols.main.exe.txt` and disassemble OUR build at that SAME
     fixed address; if anything before it has drifted, that address no
     longer holds the later function's actual compiled bytes — it shows a
     plausible-looking but SPURIOUS diff (a prologue instruction that looks
     "missing", garbage-looking-but-valid instructions, or gp-relative
     immediates all off by the SAME constant amount). The tell: the
     reported length is wildly short (e.g. "6 vs 63") or a data symbol's gp
     offset is off by a fixed delta consistently across every use in the
     function. Don't debug the downstream function for this — sort the
     batch by ADDRESS and fix upstream-first; once every earlier function
     in the batch reaches the target LENGTH (not necessarily byte-perfect,
     just the right size), later functions' comparisons become meaningful
     again (this batch: InitializeItem (earliest) needed fixing before
     ProcMiscSprite's diff made any sense at all).
4. Don't trust the byte count alone — read the diff. A change can improve the
   count while shifting registers globally (worse), or vice versa.
5. **Attempt cap.** If ~10 meaningful source changes haven't reduced the diff,
   stop and preserve the best draft with the **NON_MATCHING convention** (see
   below): the default build keeps the byte-identical stub while the draft
   stays first-class and buildable. Mark the residual (`STATUS: NON_MATCHING —
   N of M bytes differ`) and record what blocked you. decomp.me (psyq4.3
   preset) arbitrates "is this expressible at all".
   - **Sub-C-level residual early-stop (SAVES THE MOST TOKENS).** A residual of
     **≤ ~10 bytes** that is a pure **register swap** or **adjacent-instruction
     reorder** (same instructions, same registers, only order/reg-name differs)
     is often below the obvious C level — a `reload`/register-allocator
     rotation or a `sched` tie. These are *permuter-immune*: FileOption burned
     a 450k-iteration run and AdtSelect an 80k+162k run, all flat. Budget the
     permuter to **one bounded run (~5–10 min)**; if such a
     residual survives it, STOP — root-cause it against the gcc-2.8.1 sources
     (sched.c / reload.c / global.c), write the mechanism into the header, mark
     NON_MATCHING, and move on. Do NOT open more surgical sessions on it; that
     is how ~1.4M tokens produced zero additional matches this batch.
     - **The `la`/address-materialization reload tie is a NAMED member of this
       class — DON'T start the permuter on it.** When the only diff is a
       symbol address built `lui $tmp,%hi / addiu $dst,$tmp,%lo` where the
       target puts both halves in one register (`lui $dst,%hi / addiu
       $dst,$dst,%lo`), or vice versa, that's a reload-pass register choice with
       no direct expression-spelling lever. PrepareAccess (2 bytes, 87k
       permuter iters, flat) is the historical example. `cd_open` was once
       parked under the same diagnosis after ~50 minutes / **353k agent
       tokens**, but later matched exactly: moving its narrow counter increments
       after the safe early-exit tests let `reorg` place those increments in the
       target delay slots and restored the target address/copy chain. Treat this
       signature as an RTL/control-flow escalation trigger, not proof that pure C
       is unreachable: skip permutation, inspect the surrounding live ranges and
       delay-slot candidates, then park only if those source-level levers are
       exhausted.
     - **A guard's DELAY-SLOT FILL tie is a second named member.** When the only
       diff is which of two equally-ready, harmless-either-way instructions fills
       a guard branch's delay slot — the branch's own return-value setup (`move
       $v0,zero`) vs the fallthrough's first data-independent instruction (an
       address `lui`) — that is `reorg`, not source. StickonCheck: ~34k permuter
       iterations flat at 460, after trying guard-polarity inversion, literal
       Ghidra nesting, named temps and a `do{}while(0)` wrapper. Recognize and
       stop after one bounded run.
     - **Two adjacent loads in opposite order are NOT proven independent by the
       final assembly.** Compare their order through `.combine -> .sched ->
       .sched2`, inspect the candidate's sched `LOG_LINKS`, and look for a nearby
       `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END` before declaring a tie. gcc-2.8.1 makes the first
       post-LOOP_END insn a full pending register/memory fence. In
       DefaultActionHumanoid, `.combine` had `size, y, id`; sched1 changed it to
       `size, id, y` because `size` consumed that fence. Moving a full-width id
       capture between two nested loop ends gave `pointer, id, size`; duplicating
       the y load into identical arms fenced it without adding loop weight, and
       matched all 2624 bytes. Only park an adjacent-load residual after the
       pass-order and dependency checks show a genuine equal ready-list choice.
     - **A dead constant scratch feeding one narrow store can be a reload/reorg
       hard-register choice.** When length, CFG, schedule, opcodes, and every
       surrounding register agree, but `li R,K; sb R,off(base)` uses `$v1` in
       the target and `$t1` in the draft, there may be no remaining source
       identity to steer. ProcItemDokudango reached this state at two duplicated
       cleanup sites (four bytes total); 1,089 authoritative permuter candidates
       were flat. After checking the cleanup's literal/direct/local spellings,
       preserve the pure-C near-match rather than introducing a register-asm
       escape hatch.
     - **A commutative PLUS destination can be encoded by an initializing store
       plus compound update.** When target and draft differ only as
       `addu A,A,B; sw A` versus `addu B,B,A; sw B`, source operand swaps have
       already become the same plain PLUS by `.combine`. Before calling that an
       allocation tie, try `Global = A; Global += B;` and the opposite
       initializer. AttackLong's last three bytes required
       `AttackActionCount = GameClock; AttackActionCount += EngageLevel * 10;`:
       this retained `$a0` as accumulator/writeback and matched all 1248 bytes.
       A bare `AttackActionCount += ...` was insufficient; the initializing
       store is the source identity bridge. Guided
       `initialized-global-compound` emits both orders for a nonvolatile extern
       and rejects effectful/aliasable operands.
     - **A type-mode/`jump2` deadlock can yield to a zero-code narrow
       round-trip fence.** AttackShort needed two full-width `move v0,s0`
       copies, but direct SImode copies let `jump2` merge its explicit
       zero-return island, while `(u16)` copies retained the island as two
       `andi` instructions. The exact source produces zero in an SImode local,
       narrows it through an HImode local, inserts an empty one-shot loop, then
       widens it back in two identical if/else arms. Before `jump2`, those arms
       keep real CFG and the widened value is no longer tagged equal to literal
       zero; after allocation, `jump2` erases the dummy CFG and both result
       edges are plain moves. A short-lived pointer copy across the loop notes
       also prevents an otherwise extra global-pointer reload. This recovered
       all 417 instructions after a 22,046-iteration permuter had been flat.
       For `narrow-copy-zero-extension`, try this measured four-part shape
       before parking the residual or introducing assembly.
     - **Mechanical detection:** `rtlguide` retains the historical
       `adjacent-independent-load-order` signature name, but now warns that it
       is only a hypothesis and reports nearby post-LOOP_END source lines from
       `.sched`/`.sched2`. It also names `commutative-plus-destination` and
       prioritizes `initialized-global-compound` for it.
       When the adjacent loads feed one relational comparison, first swap its
       equivalent source operands: `speed < Degree` and `Degree > speed` emit
       the same `slt`, but expand evaluates the written left operand first.
       That one spelling change closed Think4chase's final eight bytes.
       `rtlguide` now prioritizes `cmp-swap`, then `loop-boundary-shift` and
       `identical-arm-fence`; the pass dump and bounded experiments remain the
       proof.
     - **BUT the permuter is stronger than this section's tone implies — do not
       skip it when the residual is the SAME LENGTH as the target.** It has since
       cracked: a 5-byte register tie (`FUN_800568b8`, ~400 iters), a 61-byte
       same-length schedule/colour miss (`AfsGetHeader`), and — a residual class
       worth naming — a pure **statement-order** fix (`FUN_80038c0c`: one field
       store had to sit one line *earlier* than its offset-order position, before
       the neighbouring word store, though every other store nearby was in strict
       offset order; 31 bytes). Statement order is a real, permuter-findable
       source lever, not a register swap. `autorules` reporting "no win" plus a
       right-length residual is the signal to permute, not to park.
6. **On MATCH:** `./Build check`, add the matching-notes header, promote any
   NEW reusable rule to this cookbook, commit the function + splat.yaml
   together.

## Picking targets

`tools/triage.py` rates every unmatched function EASY..VERY-HARD with a
"why" (size, jump table, float/GTE, loops, gp, frame, near-clone twin) and the
cookbook sections it needs — `--leverage` sorts by call in-degree (high-impact
first), `<Name>` details one. `tools/findsimilar.py --targets` ranks every
unmatched function by assembly
similarity to the matched corpus (best-first, smallest-first) — the top
entries are near-clones of things we've already solved and make good next
targets. Prefer functions from an original TU we've already touched (shared
headers like item.h and the gp-extern lists already exist for those). Batch
work: one function per matcher agent (.claude/agents/matcher.md), and commit
only on a green `./Build check`. **Don't hand-write the launch prompt** — run
`tools/matcher-prompt.py <Name>` to generate it (it also ROUTES: an exact
byte-identical twin -> tools/clonematch.py, a findsimilar-1.00 twin ->
near-clone recipe done inline in ~2 min, else a full agent prompt) (auto-fills address/size,
jump-table detection, the nearest matched worked examples, TU family, and the
current cross-cutting guidance). Update the GUIDANCE block in that script (and
this cookbook) as lessons accrue, so every future launch inherits them.

Two helpers for the setup phase:
- `tools/gpsyms.py <Name> [--write]` derives the gp-extern list from the
  function's `%gp_rel(...)` operands and (with --write) syncs it into both
  Build.hs maspsxGpExterns and permute.py GP_EXTERNS.
- `tools/maspsxflags.py <Name> [--write]` is the combined setup pass: it derives
  those gp externs, detects target variable divisions carrying ASPSX's
  `break 7`/`break 6` guards, and synchronizes both the gp and `--expand-div`
  Build.hs/permuter tables. Prefer it when starting a newly split function.
  After batch work, `tools/maspsxflags.py --check` audits every guarded draft
  against target asm and verifies that the two metadata tables remain mirrored.
- `tools/xref.py <Name>` lists callers (their call sites pin the prototype)
  and callees (matched vs needs-extern), resolved against the original image.

**Batch efficiency (measured over the debug-menu batch):**
- **Route by model.** Sonnet matched every sub-500-byte non-jump-table
  function for ~65–75k tokens each (4/4); it cost 2–5× more on jump-table or
  regalloc-heavy ones. Give Sonnet the small/simple tier, Fable the
  jump-table / big / heavy-regalloc tier.
- **Bundle a near-clone CLUSTER into ONE agent, not one-per-function.** Five
  mutually near-clone item functions (each a 1-line `it->proc` diff) matched
  in a SINGLE session for ~141k total (~28k/fn) vs ~550–750k for five separate
  agents: the setup (contract/cookbook/worked-examples/item.h) is paid once and
  the anchor's investigation IS the clones' (copy, rename, carve, build). It
  also sidesteps the merge conflicts five agents editing Build.hs/permute/yaml
  concurrently would hit. Caveat: the amortization is mostly the shared
  investigation — 5 UNRELATED functions in one session only saves the fixed
  setup. Watch for contract drift on repetition (see matcher.md).
- **Jump-table functions cost 2–3×** (split pieces + `.rodata` carve + jtbl
  array). Detect them up front (`.shake/gen/main.exe/asm/nonmatchings/<Name>/`
  has multiple `.s` pieces) and tell the agent, so it doesn't rediscover the
  split-function protocol.
- **Fix a tool bug once, centrally, the moment the first agent hits it** —
  don't let N parallel agents each re-diagnose it (the `reverse.py`
  carve-drop cost ~every debug-menu agent real tokens before it was fixed;
  agents branched from before the fix and each repaired it by hand).
- **Respect the sub-C-level early-stop** (Iteration protocol §5) — the single
  biggest token sink was deep-diving permuter-immune residuals.

### coddog (similarity at scale)

[coddog](https://github.com/ethteck/coddog) complements findsimilar.
`tools/coddog` builds it on first use (needs network + registry nixpkgs — the
flake's rust is too old); it reads `decomp.yaml`, whose input ELF is
synthesized by `tools/coddog-elf.py` from the original bytes + the Ghidra
function table (our real ELF/map aren't consumable: NOTYPE size-0 symbols, no
vrom). **Regenerate after the Ghidra export changes or after new matches**
(it also refreshes the stems dir that makes the "(decompiled)" tag truthful):

```console
$ tools/coddog-elf.py
$ tools/coddog cluster -m 4        # identical-function families: match one,
                                   #   apply to the whole cluster (e.g.
                                   #   dmyGsPrstF3NL ×108, ReqItemManebue ×5)
$ tools/coddog submatch <Name> 20  # who shares a ≥20-insn chunk with <Name> —
                                   #   the "stuck on this idiom" tool (found a
                                   #   79-insn run shared by ProcItemKusuri
                                   #   and ProcSightShot)
$ tools/coddog match <Name> -t 0.5 # similar whole functions; good for BIG
                                   #   functions, noisy under ~300 bytes — use
                                   #   findsimilar for small ones
```

For big or length-shifted functions use `tools/asmdiff.py <Name>` — it
takes the true size from the Ghidra export (matchdiff's window is capped by
mid-function symbols like switch tables) and difflib-aligns the instruction
sequences, so an insert shows as one insert instead of shifting every line
after it; `--structural` shows only the blocks that change the length (fix
those first), and pure branch-target drift is suppressed by default. An empty
`--structural` view means only that every aligned replacement has equal length;
it is **not** a byte-match result. The tool now prints both the displayed and
raw aligned residual plus `exact instruction sequence: NO`; only `matchdiff`
is the authoritative byte gate.

Treat the differing-byte count as a score to drive down (matchdiff also
reports the whole-image count: if your function assembles to a different
LENGTH, every object after it shifts and even data symbols drift — fix the
instruction count before chasing operand diffs); each structured diff
(wrong register class, wrong block order, wrong instruction) maps to one of
the rules below. When a residual diff resists source-shaping, decomp.me with
the `psyq4.3` preset arbitrates "is this expressible at all" (it runs the real
Sony compiler; our cc1 is equivalent to it — if it can't, restructure; if it
can, keep hunting). `tools/permute.py` (decomp-permuter) cracks pure
register-allocation ties.

**Trust the assembly over Ghidra's statement order.** Ghidra's EARLY temp
assignment is often an SSA artifact, not source position: `iVar1 = GLOBAL;`
rendered before a whole dispatch, used in ONE branch, usually just marks
where the tracked load sat — check whether the asm's load really spans that
far back before hoisting (PlayerOption). Ghidra's decompiler
reorders memory operations and normalizes conditions freely; the asm's store
order and branch polarity are the source's. Ghidra's SCALAR types are
gold — match its return/variable types exactly (`Think1sleep` needed
`short`/`ushort` accumulators, not `s32`). But its inferred STRUCT NAMES can
be wrong: for ReqItemJirai it invented `PARAM_ITEM_DROP` with fields shifted
4 bytes (its `p->start.vx`@4 was really `p->user`). For struct layout, trust
the **m2c reference's raw offsets** (`arg0->unk4`, seeded next to Ghidra's C)
plus the **proven shared header** (item.h's `PARAM_ITEM_USE`) over Ghidra's
struct name — item-TU Req*/Proc* functions almost always take
`PARAM_ITEM_USE *p`.

- **A bare `enum`-typed struct field is 4 bytes under this pinned cc1** (no
  `-fshort-enums`), even when every enumerator fits in one or two bytes — so a
  field spelled with the raw enum typedef silently compiles 4 bytes wide and
  shifts every later field (no warning; `-w` is on). Match the existing
  precedent: spell it `u16 name; // enum X, stored as 2 bytes` the way
  `character_kind`/`character_status` already do, never `enum X name;`
  (character_state's `weapon_kind`/`active_item`).
- **An existing Ghidra struct-field POINTER type may be an unverified guess** —
  nothing ever dereferenced it, so Ghidra typed the target from a stale/adjacent
  inference. Before trusting one, `grep` the field name: zero other usages ⇒
  it's a guess, re-derive from the bytes. Cross-check the THREE independent type
  sources — the m2c seed's raw offsets, the proven shared headers (item.h), and
  Ghidra's own fuller independently-built structs in `reference/ghidra_types.h`
  (its `Humanoid` had `think[4]`@0x60, `weapon[4]`@0x94, `illusion[2]`@0xa4 all
  correctly placed) — and match the way they agree (character_state's
  `camera_related`@0x58 was really `model`, an `ModelArchiveType*`).
- **Retail load/store width and raw offset outrank a demo symbol's reused union
  member.** Shared parameter names often describe only a common prefix, while a
  later retail processor extends or overlays it differently. If the binary says
  `lhu/sh` at +0x14 and a pointer at +0x0c, define a TU-appropriate overlay with
  exactly those widths/offsets instead of reusing a nearby struct that shifts the
  tail. ProcItemDokudango's `param_dokudango` is the worked case: the existing
  korogari view had an extra counter in the prefix, while the retail accesses
  prove `eater`@+0x0c, `org_think`@+0x10, and a `u16 count`@+0x14.

## Partial matches (the NON_MATCHING convention)

When a function is close but has a residual that resists source-shaping
(usually a scheduler or register-allocator tie below the C level — see
FileOption / AdtSelect), preserve the draft as a compile-able XOR instead of a
dead `#if 0`:

```c
#ifndef NON_MATCHING
INCLUDE_ASM(...);              /* + any jtbl array for split functions */
#else
... the best-attempt draft ...
#endif
```

Default `./Build` keeps the stub → green byte-identical image; the tools still
count the file **unmatched** (the `INCLUDE_ASM` text is present). Build the
draft with `NON_MATCHING=<Name> ./Build`; `tools/matchdiff.py`/`asmdiff.py` set
that automatically (they'd otherwise compare the trivially-matching stub), and
`tools/permute.py` preprocesses with `-DNON_MATCHING`. Head the file with
`STATUS: NON_MATCHING — N of M bytes differ` and keep the root-cause in the
header. On a later full match, delete the guards (and any jtbl array) — the
plain C is the matched file.

## Dispatch

- **An enum-typed dispatch parameter with all-non-negative enumerators
  compiles a range test UNSIGNED (`sltiu`) — a plain `s32`/`int` parameter
  gives `slti` instead.** `void f(struct T *m, enum TMsg msg)` with
  `if (MM_RESUME < msg)` (MM_RESUME the highest-valued enumerator, all
  values ≥0) emits `sltiu $v0,$a1,N` in the target; declaring the same
  parameter plain `s32` compiles the identical comparison to `slti` (same
  length, wrong instruction). Verified on two sibling functions in the same
  TU with the identical dispatch prologue (ProcMiscSprite, ProcMiscFire) —
  both need the parameter spelled as the real `enum` type, not just `s32`,
  to reproduce the unsigned compare cc1 picks for an enum whose range is
  provably non-negative.
- **Two independent `if (cond) goto L;` tests whose FALLTHROUGH is the
  short case is a different shape from a single if/else-if** — reach for
  it when BOTH non-fallthrough bodies are reached by a forward jump (not
  just one). `if (msg == A) goto do_a; if (B < msg) goto do_b; return;
  do_a: ...; return; do_b: ...;` reproduces a target where the SHORT
  "do nothing" case sits inline right after the tests and both real bodies
  are placed after it as jump targets — a plain `if (msg==A) {A} else if
  (B<msg) {B}` instead inlines the FIRST body (A) right after its own test
  and only jumps for the else-if chain, giving the wrong polarity for A's
  reachability (ProcMiscSprite, ProcMiscFire: MM_CREATE's body and the
  "draw" body are both forward-jump targets; the 1-in-3 `MM_DESTROY`/
  `MM_PAUSE`/`MM_RESUME` messages fall through the two tests straight to
  `return`).
- **Put the case whose body precedes the epilogue LAST in source**: with no
  default, the textually last case needs no trailing jump if it falls into
  the join point — a real length lever (PlayerOption's order 0,1,3,2
  recovered a wasted j/nop pair).
- **An explicit `default:` can change CSE even when it only returns.** Omitting
  the default makes the switch's out-of-range fallthrough another predecessor
  of the normal continuation; CSE then cannot carry a value proved on the
  pre-switch path and reloads it. Give the cold switch an explicit default
  return (and named close/normal labels when layout requires them) to remove
  that false predecessor. AttackGeneral's close-range `% 4` switch matched only
  in this form. Treat default presence as CFG data, not cosmetic syntax.
- **A case with a value already proven nonzero can deliberately fall through
  another case's zero-fill guard instead of jumping past it.** A decompiler can
  render two semantically equivalent gotos: one arm enters the later case's
  `if (value == 0) value = K;`, while the other skips that test. If every path
  from the earlier case has already made `value != 0`, remove both gotos and let
  the case fall through the shared test. gcc can then put the test expression in
  the preceding branch's delay slot and branch directly into the guard, which
  is distinct from targeting the following case. DamageControl's item case 0
  (`dmg` already 20) falling through case 0xe is the worked example. This stays
  a recognition rule until the nonzero proof can be made mechanically; never
  apply it when any predecessor can still carry zero.
- **Case-body memory order reveals the source case order** (the compare tree
  always sorts by value): LayoutEnemyOption's inner switch was written
  `case 1, case 2, case 0` — only the bodies show it.
  This diverges from the TEST order: expand_case sorts the compare TREE by
  value but lays bodies in SOURCE order, and a case ending in `return` is
  pushed later in memory (reached by a forward jump). Makibishi's nested
  switch needed `case 4:` before `case 1:` in source though the tests check 1
  first — check body ADDRESSES in the `.s`, not just the test order.
  In a split jump-table function, the same source order controls the sequence
  of separately carved case text islands. LoadConstruction's target order
  `0,5,2,3,11,4` cut its draft's structural block count substantially even
  though the table's numeric destinations remained value-indexed.
- **Write a binary case arm in physical fallthrough order, even when that
  makes the source predicate negative.** If retail emits `beqz value, cold`,
  the normal body, an unconditional jump to the join, and then the cold body,
  use `if (value != 0) { normal; } else { cold; }`. The logically equivalent
  positive test can make gcc place the cold body on the fallthrough path and
  invert the branch/join layout. `LoadConstruction`'s clone-or-use-loaded-model
  arm measured this directly: the normal-first spelling reduced the structural
  residual without changing its already-correct semantics or extent.
- **A shared continuation may live physically inside a later case body.** A
  decompiler commonly lifts that multi-predecessor block out below the switch,
  but doing so moves the block after every case. ActSQUAT's cases 2 and 3
  explicitly `goto move_if_stationary`, a label after case 4's private tests;
  this preserves the target order `case 2/3 branches -> case 4 prefix -> shared
  stationary continuation -> case 9`. Follow the jump-table body addresses:
  when earlier cases target the middle of a later body, keep that label there
  rather than forcing a cosmetically structured post-switch join.
- **Identical-valued case bodies can still be distinct physical islands.** Do
  not factor equal case results through a temporary until the target proves
  they were merged. ActCHASE's item switch contains two separate `motID =
  0xf02` islands: writing a shared `selected_motion` collapsed them, while
  direct global assignments in target body order (`2,1,3,6,5,7`) preserved
  both. Its terminating sound/default cases also had to `goto` labels placed
  after the normal cases' shared `D_80097F0E = 1; return;` tail. This recipe—
  order value-producing cases by physical address, keep direct stores, and
  route terminating cases around the shared tail—restored the exact jump
  inventory. It is a structural recognition rule; use body addresses and
  control-flow counts as the oracle rather than blindly permuting case values.
- **Three sparse literal equalities may need `switch`, even without a jump
  table.** gcc 2.8.1's `expand_case` builds a value-sorted comparison tree but
  keeps case bodies in source order. FUN_8005b17c's `0x20`, `0x2000`, and
  `0x8000` pad tests required the exact `0x2000`-centred tree and separately
  placed tails; nested `if`s were twelve bytes short. Guided autorules rule
  `sparse-eq-switch` recognizes a three-arm equality ladder over one
  nonvolatile local and tests all six case-body orders mechanically.
- **A three-way value ladder may need its literal default BEFORE both tests.**
  `if (A) x=ONE; else { x=DEFAULT; if (B) x=TWO; }` and
  `x=DEFAULT; if (A) x=ONE; else if (B) x=TWO;` have the same final automatic
  value, but the latter lets reorg put the default definition in a comparison
  branch delay slot and leaves the two overrides as explicit outcome islands.
  In `Think4contact` that source shape restored the missing unconditional jump
  and inline zero-path conversion, taking a 183-byte/eight-byte-short park
  directly to exact. Guided `default-ladder-hoist` recognizes only three plain
  literal assignments to one nonvolatile unaddressed local, empty arms apart
  from those assignments, no second nested else, and conditions that do not
  read the destination. This is the general-literal counterpart to the 0/1-only
  `flag-arm-assign` rule.
- **A switch's shared continuation sitting physically BETWEEN two case bodies
  is NOT after-switch code — it is a duplicated tail.** When the target shows
  e.g. `item->mode++; return;` in the middle of the case bodies (case 0 ends in
  a `j` with its lone store in the delay slot, then the increment+return appears,
  then case 1), each of case 0 and case 1 ended in a *literal duplicated*
  `item->mode = item->mode + 1; return;` and jump2 cross-jumped them into the
  LAST copy (case 1's). Writing one shared statement after the `switch` instead
  lays the join after ALL bodies — wrong placement. Duplicate the tail into each
  case (ProcItemKawarimi, ProcItemGun, ProcItemDokudango).
- **Duplicate a complete terminal tail when an identical-arm allocation donor
  has the right registers but the wrong first-store schedule.** Duplicating only
  the first store gives `jump2` too little block structure to move the store;
  putting the remaining stores and `return` in every arm can preserve the
  donor's global-allocation weights while changing which physical tail survives
  cross-jumping. An isolated GetAreaMapVector experiment kept its exact
  548-byte extent and persistent saved-register homes while reducing 40
  differing bytes to 33 by recovering the target's first constant/store order.
  Treat this as a bounded scheduling probe, not a guaranteed win:
  `record_jump_equiv` may then prove the returned value equal to a constant and
  replace a wanted register copy with a fresh literal load.
- **The switch index register doubling as the constant it matched.** A
  `sw`/`sh` store of the literal case value *inside* a case body (ProcItemGun's
  `common = (void *)1;` under `case 1:`) is cse's `record_jump_equiv` on the
  `beq index,CONST` taken edge: the pseudo==constant equivalence survives calls,
  so a plain literal constant in source reproduces the store while ALSO forcing
  the dispatch index into a callee-saved register. Don't hand-substitute a
  variable for the literal, and don't be alarmed the switch index is callee-saved.
- A mode-dispatcher that **reloads its variable** (two `lbu` of the same
  field) and compares **signed** (`slti`) is a real **`switch`**: cc1's
  `expand_case` emits a balanced compare tree over a *fresh* index load. An
  if/goto-ladder CSEs the load into one `lbu` and compares small unsigned
  types with `sltiu`. Case bodies are laid out in source order. A decompiler's
  long state ladder can therefore need to be restored as one full `switch`, even
  when labels/gotos initially look closer: ProcItemDokudango recovered both the
  compare tree and the physical mode-body order only after doing so.
- **If an entry guard names that field, a dead overwrite can be required to
  preserve the switch's fresh reload.** `mode_index = item->mode;` followed by
  a guard normally leaves a CSE equivalence that lets a later
  `switch (item->mode)` reuse the first `lbu`. When the target has a second
  `lbu`, write `mode_index = 0;` immediately before the switch. The assignment
  is dead and emits no code, but evicts the equivalence before `expand_case`
  (ProcItemKaengeki). Guided `autorules` enumerates this only when the named
  automatic local is provably unused from the switch onward, as
  `switch-cse-evict`.
- **A jump-table dispatch that opens `lhu / addiu -BASE / sll 16 / sra 16 /
  sltiu N` is a cast-narrowed switch index** — spell it
  `switch ((short)(ptr->mid - 0xA00))`. The `(short)` cast narrows the subtract
  to HImode: a raw `lhu` load plus a HImode `addiu`, then the switch promotion
  itself emits the `sll 16 / sra 16` sign-extension. A plain `switch (ptr->mid)`
  with `0xA00`-based case labels subtracts in SImode off an `lh` load — no
  sll/sra, wrong shape (ActHANG, dispatching on MotionManager.mid).
- **An explicit `if (cond) goto L;` ladder decouples test ORDER from body
  LAYOUT** — reach for it when an N-way dispatch fires its tests in a different
  order than the bodies sit in memory. cd_seek's 3-way `whence` dispatch tests
  1,0,2 but lays bodies out 0,2,1 (SEEK_CUR last, falling into the merge): a
  `switch` adds a range-split `slti` and an `if/else if` inlines each body right
  after its own test, but `if (whence==1) goto a; if (whence==0) goto b; …` with
  the *labels* ordered 0,2,1 reproduces the test sequence and the body addresses
  independently.
  This also applies when one path must **skip an earlier cleanup/drop block**
  and enter a later aim/sight block. ProcItemArrow needed an explicit early
  `goto aim;` for a valid attached human, preserving the retail forward skip
  around the invalid-human path. ProcSightShot similarly placed drop/common
  dispose before `sight_mode` and jumped into the later block. Structured
  nesting or one factored tail changed physical block order and cross-jump
  scope even though the path conditions were identical.
- A preceding test that keeps its constant in a **callee-saved register**
  across calls (`li $s4, 0xFF` + later `sb $s4`) is a local variable
  (`u8 ff = 0xff;`) also used by a later store. A path where the same value is
  materialized fresh (`li $v1, 0xFF`) uses a literal there — the register got
  reused for something else in between.
  - **Corollary (caller-saved `ff`):** the `u8 ff = 0xff;` entry-compare
    variable is instead *caller-saved* (`$a1`/`$v1`) when the path from the
    entry test to the dispose store `item->mode = ff` crosses NO call. Checking
    `item->proc` INLINE (`if (item->proc)` with no `ppu` temp) is what allocates
    `$v0` for both the null test and the `jalr` (ProcItemGun/ProcItemKawarimi).
  - **These two levers can be atomic, not independently scoreable.** At
    ProcItemDokudango's exact-length four-byte residual, replacing only the
    function-wide `u8 ff` with literal `0xff`, or only the block-local `proc`
    variables with direct `item->proc` tests/calls, grew the function to 2,472
    bytes and split an earlier shared cleanup. Applying both together kept the
    indirect target in `$v0`, rematerialized the late literals in `$v1`, and
    let jump2 recover the exact cleanup. A single-axis permuter cannot discover
    this valley-crossing change. `literal-indirect-inline` now recognizes the
    bounded `u8` constant plus null-tested function-pointer-field pattern and
    submits the complete pair as one candidate.
- **De-Morgan layout lever — `||` vs `&&` place the bodies differently.** cc1
  always emits the THEN body physically first, so `if (a != 0 || b != 0) {BIG}
  else {SMALL}` and `if (a == 0 && b == 0) {SMALL} else {BIG}` (logically
  identical) compile to *different* code. Read the polarity off the asm: `||`
  gives `bnez a, BIG; beqz b, SMALL` (BIG falls through / is first); `&&` gives
  `bnez a, BIG; bnez b, BIG` (SMALL is first). When the small "stop" body sits
  right after the condition reached by a `beqz` on the second test, write the
  `||` form (MoveHumanoid's zero-speed guard).

- **cc1 collapses a logically-redundant `&&` chain, dropping a branch the
  binary has**: `if (x != 0 && x == 1 && other)` compiles to `if (x == 1 &&
  other)` — the provably-redundant `!= 0` test's `beqz` is gone. Ghidra shows
  the redundant form (logical, not physical, structure), so trusting it
  under-produces instructions. NEST instead of chain — `if (x != 0) { if
  (x == 1 && other) {…} }` — to keep both branches (ProcItemLightningBolt).
- Branch-if-equal *into* a physically-later block with the fallthrough being
  the other body usually means the source condition was the **opposite
  polarity** of Ghidra's rendering (`if (0xe < n) {...} else {...}` vs
  Ghidra's `if (n < 0xf)` with swapped bodies).
  - **EXCEPTION — a null-guard clause with two returns keeps Ghidra's LITERAL
    polarity.** When both arms terminate in `return` with no shared merge
    (`if (handle == 0) { error; return E; } success; return S;`), the guard body
    is the branch TARGET that falls straight into the epilogue and the success
    body is the fallthrough-plus-jump — so writing the null-check first in
    Ghidra's own `== 0` sense is what matches. Inverting to `if (handle != 0)
    {success} else {error}` transposes both (correct) blocks for a pure ~29-byte
    layout diff. Very common in the C-layer wrappers (cd_close/Afs* family); the
    opposite-polarity rule above is for a single if/else over a comparison, not
    this guard-clause-with-two-returns shape.
    - **…but flip back when the "rest" arm carries the loop's own back-edge.**
      `if (match) return X; … keep-searching goto-loop …; return FALLBACK;`
      relocates the `return X` to the function's far end — instead invert the
      condition and NEST the keep-searching + fallback inside the `if`, leaving
      the found-return as the final unnested statement (GetItemType).
    - **…and flip back when the "success" arm's last statement is a tail-called
      return.** `if (idx == -1) { return 0; } …; return f(0);` in Ghidra's
      literal polarity runs 4 bytes long (inverted branch + a skip-jump around
      the success block); write success-with-tail-call FIRST
      (`if (idx != -1) { …; return f(0); } return 0;`) so the call's result
      (already in `$v0`) is the last code before the epilogue with no extra move
      (leRemoveEnemy).
    - **…and flip back when the SUCCESS arm is the longer one.** The literal-
      polarity rule assumes the error arm is short (a `return E;` that folds into
      the epilogue). When success is the long arm — several statements, a nested
      `if`, a handful of calls — and especially when a local is live across both
      arms, Ghidra's literal polarity compiles backwards. **Nest the long arm**
      (`if (fd != 0) { …; return buff; } error; return E;`), leaving the short
      error tail unnested and last (LoadFromCDROM). The one-line test: which arm
      would you rather have fall through into the epilogue? The short one.
- **Don't reuse the switch variable inside case bodies across calls**: a
  dispatch-only variable dies at the case tree and lives in a caller-saved
  reg (`move $v1,$v0` after the call that produced it). Assigning a later
  call result to the *same* variable inside a case body extends one pseudo's
  life across calls → it's promoted to a callee-saved reg, adding a prologue
  save and shifting the whole function by one instruction. Use a separate
  case-local variable (DoInfoViewProc: `sel` dispatches, the helpers' `n`
  takes the sub-menu results in $s0).
- **A tests-then-bodies ladder for two values is a nested `switch`**:
  `beqz $sN → bodyA; li $v0,1; beq $sN,$v0 → bodyB; j end` with both bodies
  laid out after the tests is `switch (n) { case 0: ...; case 1: ...; }`.
  An `if (n==0) ... else if (n==1)` chain puts the first body on the
  fallthrough path instead — and because that keeps the second body in the
  same extended basic block as the `li 1` compare, cse reuses $v0 for a later
  constant-1 argument (`move $a2,$v0`); the switch's branch-taken bodies get
  a fresh `li $a2,1` like the original (cse tables don't follow the taken
  edge).

### Preserve the raw value and adjusted table index as separate roles

When one remapped character controls both a table index and a later range adjustment,
keep the remapped character intact and copy it to an index local: `ch = *p; if (ch ==
0x92) ch = 0x27; index = ch; if (index > 0x1f) index -= 0x20; if (ch > 0xbf) index -=
0x40;`. In `FUN_800570b8`, that literal split emits the target's branch-delay copy from
`ch` to `index`, retains `ch` for the upper-kana test, and removes the synthesized
boolean/`xori` chain. The earlier boolean draft was useful evidence but not the original
source shape; a lower permuter score for an inlined comparison still produced the wrong
length, so verify every candidate with `matchdiff`.

The same exact match exposed two adjacent ordering rules. If direct use of several
parameters makes cc1 save/copy them before an explicitly initialized cursor, introduce
source-ordered local aliases (`cursor = x; text = str; ypos = y;`) and use those aliases
throughout; their RTL creation order recovered the prologue and also stopped a later
constant call argument from being stolen into an earlier branch delay slot. For paired
quad coordinates, right-associate field assignments in the reverse store order:
`x0 = x2 = cursor`, `y0 = y1 = ypos`, `y2 = y3 = ypos + 15`, and `x1 = x3 = end_x`
emit stores to `x2,x0`, `y1,y0`, `y3,y2`, and `x3,x1`, respectively.

### A "short do-nothing case falls through, both real bodies are jump targets" 3-way

When a 3-way dispatch has one trivial (do-nothing / early-return) case and two
substantial bodies both reached by forward jumps, spell it with explicit gotos to BOTH
non-trivial bodies testing the ORIGINAL conditions: `if (cond_a) goto A; if (cond_b) goto
B; return; A: …; B: …;`. Not `if/else`, and not an inline-return for the second guard --
those change which body falls through (`FUN_8004c59c`/`FUN_8004d6d4` periodic-emitter
think functions).

### An adjacent equality return/goto guard has two physical spellings

`if (x != K) return; goto body;` and
`if (x == K) goto body; return;` have identical C control flow, but the old
compiler sees opposite source consequences and fallthroughs. That changes the
branch polarity and which terminal island jump2 can cross-jump. ActSQUAT's
final `dtCMD == 0x14` leaf needed the second spelling so the invalid-command
return stayed inline while the valid leaf reached the later motion-store body.

Guided `autorules` rule `terminal-guard-flip` now toggles this exact adjacent
`==`/`!=` shape in either direction. It requires one return and one goto, no
`else`, and no intervening comments, so it preserves the CFG rather than
inventing a general body-layout rewrite. `rtlguide` prioritizes it for the
`guard-return-island-layout` residual before broader `if-else-invert` trials.

### A per-axis raw computation needs a temp distinct from its final assigned value

Even when Ghidra renders both roles through one reassigned SSA variable, a raw
product/subtraction (`dx*dx`, `a - b`) fed into a later result must be a SEPARATE
short-lived temp from the value ultimately assigned; reusing one variable forces the whole
computation into a callee-saved register instead of a caller-saved one (`FUN_80039ddc`).

For paired axes, preserve the **definition order** separately too: cache the X
coefficient, then compute/apply X's delta; cache a distinct Z coefficient, then
compute/apply Z. Hoisting both coefficients together or reusing one coefficient
local changes pseudo lifetimes and load scheduling even though the arithmetic is
identical. DefaultActionHumanoid's reflection correction needs this
coefficient-X/input-X/output-X then coefficient-Z/input-Z/output-Z shape. A
decompiler's one reassigned SSA temp is not evidence that the original reused the
source variable.

The inverse applies when the subtraction result itself survives as a later call
argument. In `Think1random`, the target ties each loaded locate component to the
destination of `chase - locate`, then preserves those two differences in `$a0/$a1`
through separate absolute-value temporaries. The split scratch chain
`x=A; scratch=B; z=C; x=x-scratch; z=z-D;` created extra operand/result
identities and a ten-byte allocation tie; writing `x=A-B; z=C-D;` matched
directly. PSX.SYM's `long vx/vz` names corroborated that those locals were the
differences, not coordinate scratches. Guided `difference-role-fuse` recognizes
only five adjacent plain assignments over pure field reads, three nonvolatile
unaddressed locals, and a scratch whose first later occurrence is an overwrite.
Use the target's subtraction destination and downstream call argument to decide
whether this direct-result identity or the separate-raw-temp rule above applies.

### A dual-role dispatch test can be the opposite shape of its goto-ladder

Ghidra's `if (A == 0 && (side-effect, B == 0)) { short } else { long }` can really be
`if (A != 0) goto long; if (B == 0) goto short;` with `long` as the fall-through.
Same family as the two-independent-`goto` rule, but here BOTH bodies are
substantial — neither is a trivial do-nothing case.

### `if (cond) A; else B;` makes A the fall-through and negates `cond`

Independent of De Morgan. cc1 compiles `if (cond) A; else B;` as `if (!cond) goto B;`
with `A` falling through. So when the target's own branch tests `cond` *directly* and
branches away to the **trivial** body while the **complex** body falls through, the
source had the bodies the other way round from what you would naturally write. Spell
it `if (cond) goto trivial; <complex>; goto join; trivial: <trivial>; join:`.

This also buys the reorg trick where one branch eagerly assigns in its delay slot and
the other unconditionally overrides it on fall-through. Verified on `FUN_8003a2a8`'s
`[0, 0x4e1]` clamp: `if (t < 0) goto zero; pri = 0x4e1; if (t < 0x4e2) pri = t;
goto done; zero: pri = 0; done:` reproduces the target's `bltz` + eager `li` +
overriding `move`, where the natural `if (t < 0) pri = 0; else { … }` compiled to
`bgez` — same instructions, wrong polarity, and an extra misplaced jump.

### A guard clause with no second `return` is a plain `if`, compiled via De Morgan

`if (cond) { noreturn_call(); } <rest unconditionally>` — no `else`, no second
`return` — reproduces the target's "short fail body inline, long body reached by a
forward jump" layout. `CreateHumanoid`'s
`if (mad == 0 || Humans >= 0x28) { SystemOut(…); }` is the real shape; Ghidra renders
it backwards as `if (mad != 0 && Humans < 0x28) {…} SystemOut(…);` because there is no
second return to anchor the guard-clause exception.

### A search loop's own entry-duplicated test is the only guard needed

`if (0 < Humans) { for (i = 0; i < Humans; i++) … }` compiles the SAME `0 < Humans`
test TWICE — cc1 does not dedupe the outer `if` against the `for`'s own hoisted entry
test. Drop the outer `if` and you get one `blez` (`KillHumanoid`, and its exact twin
`GetHumanoid`).

### An `&&`-chain's body is always the fallthrough after the last test

If the target has the *opposite* body as the fallthrough, no `goto` ladder and no
restructuring that preserves the guard's polarity will fix it — the tests compile to
the same instructions either way, only the body layout differs. The single lever is
De Morgan: invert the `&&`-chain into an early-return `||` guard, which changes which
body is "the then". `CGetLevel`'s 6-way guard needed exactly this; Ghidra had rendered
the polarity backwards.

### A `return 0x80000000;`-style guard constant needs a label past the main tail

`goto ret_min;` to a label at the function's *very end*, after the normal tail.
Put the label anywhere earlier and the constant's `lui` floats up into the guard
branch's own delay slot — a 6-byte tie.

### Two-guard-then-fall-through dispatch reaches one shared return tail

`if (A) goto a; if (B) goto b; goto tail; a: …; goto tail; b: …; tail: return v;`
is what you need whenever several case bodies must converge on a *single* shared
return via cross-jump. Three separate `return EXPR;` statements each compile their
own full tail instead. (See also the shared-tails rule.)

### Guard-clause `return 0;`s all cross-jump into the LAST plain island

When the target has one conditional branch but the candidate has the inverse
conditional followed by `nop; j shared_return`, the residual is physical guard
layout, not missing behavior. `rtlguide` reports this as
`guard-return-island-layout`. Try the guided `if-else-invert` spelling or one
explicit shared return label once; if the target/candidate RTL still chooses
opposite islands, park it rather than reacting to the large address-drift byte
count. `SearchTarget` was semantically complete with an exact 0x50 frame and
stack access plan, but one such extra skip instruction made 572 bytes appear
different despite only five aligned hunks.

Every `return 0;` compiles to its own `[v0=0; j]` island, and jump2's cross-jump merges
them ALL into the last plain island in emission order. So an `if (cond) { body }
return 0;` at the end puts the shared `return 0` at the function END, while an inline
`if (cond) return 0;` guard keeps it mid-function — and which mid-function label the
guards branch to in the target tells you which form the original used. Related: a
conditional store block falling into a shared `return 0` — `if (c) { stores } return 0;`
vs `if (!c) return 0; stores; return 0;` — differ ONLY in basic-block boundaries:
same-block `v0=0` gets hoisted by sched1 into a load-delay hole (inline `move v0,zero` +
direct `j` to the epilogue), separate-block `v0=0` survives for cross-jump (`j` to a
return-0 island). Both shapes can coexist in one function (`HangCheck`).

### A guard returning the constant its own test produced wants a bare `goto`

`if (cond) return X;` followed by more code, where `X` is a compile-time constant
**equal to the value the guard's own test left in `$v0`**, compiles one instruction
too long: the literal `return X;` forces a `li $v0,X`. Write
`if (cond) goto end; ... end: return;` instead — the pre-existing test register
carries the value for free. Sharing one label across several such guards lets each
reach it with a single branch (`ItemUse`'s `item[4]==0` and `d >= 300` guards).

## Loops

### A for-loop's duplicated entry test branching to a shared `return K` is a folded guard

Write `i = 0; if (i >= N) goto ret_k;` immediately before `for (; i < N; i++)`. cse1's
`record_jump_equiv` records the guard's comparison on its FIRST slt operand's quantity,
so the guard MUST compare the INDEX against N — `if (N < 1)` records on N's quantity and
never folds (both `blez`s survive, a real trap). The loop must stay a real `for`: its
`NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP` is what makes reorg predict the loop-internal skip branch taken and
duplicate the increment (`addiu v0,a2,1`) into both skip delay slots; a `do`/`while`
loses those fills (`GetConflictResult`, the deepest of its three residuals).

### A success `return X` keeping its own `jr` needs a zero-byte blocker before function end

When the target's success path has its own `jr` with the value in the delay slot (rather
than jumping to a shared epilogue), nest the entry guard —
`if (id != -1) { … } return -1;` — so the final `return -1` is the guard's else. cse
elides its `li` along the taken edge (single-pred label), and the surviving bare
CODE_LABEL blocks jump.c from deleting the success return's jump-to-next, letting reorg's
`make_return_insns` convert it to its own return and fill the slot
(`GetConflictResult`; DeleteConflict's own style).



- `for (init; cond; inc)` and `while (cond)` expand with a jump to a
  bottom test; jump.c's `duplicate_loop_exit_test` (fires only when
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` is immediately followed by a simplejump) then copies
  the exit test to the entry, where a provable initial value constant-folds it
  away → **bottom-test do-while shape**.
- **A bottom-tested scan can require its cursor-pointer derivation at the TOP
  of a real `while` body.** `i = 0; while (buf[i]) { p = buf; p += i; ...; }`
  makes the duplicated entry test consume `buf[i]`, then forms `p` as the
  body's first operation.  At the back edge cc1 independently forms the
  address for the bottom test and the next iteration's `p` (the latter can
  fill the branch delay slot).  The logically equivalent
  `if (buf[0]) do { ...; p = buf + i; } while (buf[i]);` puts both expressions
  in one extended block, so cse reuses one address and emits an instruction
  less.  AfsFindFile proved the A/B: only the real-`while`, two-statement
  cursor spelling reproduces its entry `i=0` placement and distinct bottom
  `buf[i]`/next-body pointer calculations.
- **`while (1) { if (!(cond)) break; ...; i++; }`** keeps the original's
  **top-test + unconditional back-jump** shape (first insn after the loop
  note is a condjump → no duplication) *and* still gets loop.c's invariant
  hoisting (address pseudos, division magic constants moved to the preheader).
  LoadConstruction demonstrates the large-function diagnostic: its natural
  outer record loop and final map loop each hoist the signed-division `16000`
  magic once, while equivalent hand labels repeat the `lui`/`ori` sequence at
  every division site.
- **A provably zero initial index can still need an explicit pre-loop test.**
  In LoadConstruction's slot-disposal traversal, spelling `i = 0; if (i < n)`
  around a `for (; i < n; i++)` and naming the invariant pointer masks lets
  cc1 hoist those masks while retaining the target's separate entry and
  backedge tests. The ordinary `for (i = 0; i < n; i++)` was semantically
  identical but scheduled the whole traversal differently. Require both the
  duplicated target test and exact invariant placement before using this
  source-shape lever.
- A hand-rolled `label: if (...) goto...` loop also keeps the top test but
  **loses hoisting** (no loop notes → loop.c skips it): magic divisors and
  invariant addresses get rematerialized per iteration. Wrong.
- **A mask in the next axis test's branch delay slot usually comes from a
  separate post-division assignment, not from the final array subscript.** For
  repeated signed coordinate bucketing, spell `x &= mask;`, `y &= mask;`, and
  `z &= mask;` immediately after their respective positive/negative division
  ladders, then index with the already-masked values. Leaving `x & mask` only
  in the final multidimensional address keeps all masks late and changes both
  scheduling and saved-register reuse. `LoadConstruction` recovered the first
  two retail delay-slot masks and substantially reduced its large case-2
  residual this way. This is not a compiler barrier: an independent call can
  still let the final mask move, so verify every axis in the emitted assembly.
- **Repeated per-axis normalization usually has one shared loop, not nested
  component loops.** A decompiler may render `vx`, `vy`, and `vz` as successive
  nested tests/divisions because their branches rotate into one another. When
  the target repeats the same abs-threshold test for all three components,
  updates a single scale, and shares one back-edge/tail, recover one loop that
  halves all three components per iteration. Compare the per-axis def/use order
  in `.loop`/`.jump2`; blind statement permutations obscure the rotation.
  DamageControl's passage vector is the worked large-function case.
- **A repeated entry/backedge abs test may need `__builtin_abs` at both
  sites to stop an unwanted cross-jump.** DamageControl's ternary-abs entry
  test merged into the loop tail, hiding six instructions; mixed `/ 2` and
  `>> 1` component updates only compensated for the lost size.  Spelling all
  three halves as arithmetic shifts and both threshold ladders as
  `__builtin_abs((int)component)` restores two distinct tests and makes the
  entire normalization region structurally exact.  That paired change moved
  the exact-length draft from 2056 to 1418 differing bytes; changing only the
  halves or only the abs spelling gives a misleading length mismatch.
- **A `short` loop counter SUPPRESSES loop.c's strength reduction.** loop.c needs
  a plain SImode giv to rewrite `arr[i].f` into a walking induction pointer, so an
  `int i` gets you `p += 8` per iteration. A `short i` instead keeps the target's
  recompute-from-base shape — the counter's own sign-extend fuses with the scale
  (`(i<<16)>>13` for an 8-byte element), and the address is rebuilt as
  `base + i*8` every iteration. When the target recomputes but your draft walks a
  pointer, narrow the counter before touching anything else (SetupMotionRegist).
  (Not to be confused with the *3-instruction* GetPad sign-extension class.)
- **A rotated sentinel scan can be the direct `while (table[i] != needle)`
  source, with one narrow counter reused by a later disjoint scan.**  For a
  signed-short `i`, `i = 0; while (table[i] != needle) { if (limit <= i) break;
  i++; }` emits the initial element load before the loop, computes `i + 1` into
  a working register, loads the next element through that value, and writes the
  new `i` in the back-branch delay slot.  A decompiler-shaped wide counter plus
  separate narrow index obscures that rotation and invites add-0x10000 strength
  reduction.  If a later scan re-zeroes an equivalent short and the target uses
  the same hard register for both nonoverlapping lifetimes, reuse the same C
  local: two separate shorts can still receive different caller registers.
  `ActivateHumans` combined the direct sentinel loop, the shared short, and the
  later StageChar induction fix while preserving its exact 1,608-byte extent
  and physical CFG; the authoritative residual fell 730→360 bytes and the
  structural report fell 54→5 length-changing lines.
- **Put a loop increment inside the array subscript when the target increments
  through a narrow working copy.** `array[i] = value; i++;` updates `i` in
  place. The equivalent `array[i++] = value;` can instead expand as
  `addiu work,i,1; move i,work`, then reuse `work` for the counter's narrow
  sign-extension/test. That apparently redundant copy was the last missing
  instruction in ActKAGI and is also the documented shape in parked
  now-exact FUN_800270f8. `autorules` tries both forms as `subscript-postinc`, limited to
  a nonvolatile, non-address-taken local used only once in the affected full
  expression; `rtlguide` names the `postincrement-working-copy` residual. In
  SetupWeapon, this one rewrite also moved the reused `short` counter from `$v1`
  to the target's `$a1`; that identity carried into the following direct
  sentinel scan and removed all 47 residual bytes without changing the
  1,128-byte extent. Treat a postincrement mismatch as a possible downstream
  allocation root cause, not just a local loop-scheduling difference.
  If that indexed field is both read and written in the iteration, capture its
  address at the postincrement site—`u16 *attribute =
  &model->object[i++]->attribute; value = *attribute; ...; *attribute = value;`.
  The earlier `idx=i; i=idx+1; ...object[idx]...` spelling could not produce the
  working copy because the increment was detached from ARRAY_REF. Also keep the
  pointer/value temps block-local to **each** disjoint loop: sharing them across
  FUN_800270f8's set/clear loops merged their allocnos, raised priority, and
  swapped `$a0/$v0` even though their live ranges never overlap.
- **A working copy's one surviving `move` can migrate between its seed and its
  writeback.** The narrow RTL/assembly signature is target
  `addu work,work,delta; move persistent,work; sll use,work,16` versus candidate
  `addu persistent,work,delta; sll use,persistent,16`, often accompanied by an
  earlier candidate-only `work = seed; persistent = work` copy. Treat the two
  sites as one identity problem. Seed the persistent value directly, then
  merge the later rebuild and compound update:
  `persistent = seed; ...; work = persistent - K + delta; persistent = work`.
  In ActSTICKON, changing either site alone made the 812-instruction draft one
  instruction short; the atomic pair preserved length, moved the copy to the
  target site, and reduced the authoritative residual from 372 to 127 bytes.
  `rtlguide` names this `arithmetic-working-copy` and prioritizes guided
  `working-copy-seed-merge`, which requires unique unaddressed nonvolatile
  signed-32 locals, a pure rebuild, and no intervening use of the work local.
  Its checkpoint replay is `(False,372,54,0) -> (False,127,52,0)`. The fuzzy
  percentage stayed 94.83 despite that large byte win; refresh its source hash
  anyway because fuzzy is only a structural display heuristic.
- **A defined self-XOR update can retain a working-copy writeback that plain
  assignment coalesces away.** For initialized scalar `persistent`,
  `persistent ^= persistent ^ work` is exactly `persistent = work`, but old
  cc1 carries the old persistent identity far enough for allocation to keep
  `work` distinct. In ActSTICKON, pairing that spelling with a split rand
  update recovered the target's `addu work,...; move persistent,work` and
  restored the exact 812-instruction extent; plain assignment made the draft
  one instruction short. This is valid only when the left operand is already
  initialized, is an ordinary unaliased scalar, and bitwise XOR preserves its
  value domain.
- **A call-base capture and a signed comparison working copy can be an atomic
  scheduler/allocation repair.** ActSTICKON's pad block needed `pad_rv = rv`
  after its direction loop and `update_motion = dtM` only after the early-exit
  test. Together they put the signed comparison value in `$a2`, reserve `$a0`
  for the call base, and hoist that load to the target slot. Either role left
  implicit let the comparison occupy `$a0` and delayed the global load. Keep
  captures after guards that dominate every use so their live range models the
  target rather than merely increasing allocation weight.
- **Split a shared comparison label when one predecessor needs a literal-load
  landing pad.** In ActSTICKON's camera ladder, the peep-left branch targets a
  separate `camera_peep_left:` label that materializes direction 3 before
  falling into the shared left comparison. Assigning 3 before `goto
  camera_left` put it in the branch delay slot and changed the physical target.
  Equivalent arm inversion likewise recovered the intended fallthrough for
  the item-selection and throw-angle ladders. Verify the linked branch targets:
  the C conditions alone do not reveal this distinction.
- **A sentinel-record scan with a special first row may need the scan backedge
  written explicitly.** A structured loop can let cc1 peel or specialize the
  known `i == 0` row, changing physical block order even when its comparisons
  look right. In ActDEAD, testing row zero once and then spelling the repeated
  scan with a label/goto preserved the target's dispatch order. Keep the
  counter update natural (`i++;`) at that backedge before inventing a `next`
  temporary: with the `short` counter live across the sentinel test, cc1 emits
  the target's separate next-index and next-record registers and commits the
  index in the branch delay slot. This is a CFG/allocation lever, so require
  the target's branch order and a narrow residual before trying it.
- **Disjoint narrow loops do not have to share one source counter.** Reusing a
  function's earlier `short i` for a later table scan can join their allocno
  preferences and rotate the scan's address/index registers even though the
  live ranges do not overlap. Give the later scan its own block-scoped
  `short scan_i` when the target uses a different hard-register colouring
  (ActKAGI; independently confirmed by SwimCheck's splash loop and later
  CVAhuman scan). This is a scope/regalloc lever, not a semantic loop change.
- **Disjoint passes need not share one stack-backed carrier.** If the target
  keeps a value in a callee-saved register in an early pass but reloads the
  same logical role from a stack slot in a later pass, model them as separate
  source objects. In LoadConstruction, routing both model-size calculations
  through the final pass's `scratch.stack.msize` removed `$fp` from the save
  mask and rotated the whole case-2 register family. A block-local first-pass
  `msize`, while leaving the later stack field intact, restored the exact save
  set and helped reduce the linked residual from 2235 to 727 bytes. Require
  both the target storage classes and disjoint live ranges before splitting;
  this is an allocation reconstruction, not a generic preference for locals.
- **Conversely, repeated hard-register identities can recover WHICH named
  counter drove each disjoint loop.** When PSX.SYM records `int i, j, k` but a
  decompiler renders every nested scan with anonymous indices, compare the
  target counters across the separate loops. ArrangeLocalMatrix's first
  row-normalisation loop and deepest elimination loop both use `$a2`, while
  the intervening row loop uses `$t4`: the original reused `k` for the two
  `$a2` loops and reserved `j` for the `$t4` loop. Using `j` for the first two
  adjacent loops was semantically identical and exact-length, but rotated 44
  bytes of caller-saved registers; changing only that loop variable to `k`
  produced a full match. Use `rtlguide`'s local names and `regalloc`'s pseudo
  dispositions to corroborate the grouping before adding artificial loop
  weights or narrowing a debug-proven `int`.
- **Sibling scans in one function can deliberately use different loop forms.**
  In StartStageSequence the first scans are `while`, but the third reorder loop
  and the score loop must be `for`. Their otherwise similar bodies are not a
  reason to normalize the source: only the `for` loop notes make reorg copy the
  top-of-loop `i+1` into two branch delay slots. Writing all loops as `while`
  produced the exact frame, registers, and bodies but was exactly two
  instructions short. When target-only increments sit in branch slots, compare
  `.loop`/`.dbr` before adding explicit duplicate increments.
- **Index the table (`T[i].f`) rather than walking a pointer (`e++`) when the
  loop touches two or more fields.** With a walking pointer cc1 strength-reduces
  the induction variable so that the LAST field it touches sits at offset 0 —
  the base comes out biased (`addiu $a2,$v0,8`, accesses at `-4($a2)`/`0($a2)`).
  Array indexing keeps the giv at the table base, so the accesses stay at their
  natural `4($a2)`/`8($a2)` (FUN_800568b8; the `addiu $a2,$a2,0xC` bottom
  increment is identical either way, so the *bias* is the only tell).
  - **Indexing can also steer preheader scheduling even when the final pointer
    induction is byte-for-byte the same.** A source pointer cursor creates its
    initializer before loop optimization; `T[index]` with an `s32` index lets
    loop.c eliminate the BIV, strength-reduce a GIV, and create the equivalent
    pointer initializer later. That later RTL UID can move the table address
    after another hoisted address in sched2 without changing the loop body or
    registers. In `check_for_known_button_combination`, this changed the three
    preheader instructions from constant/table/history to the target's
    constant/history/table and closed the final 12 bytes. Require `.loop` to
    report the BIV elimination/GIV reduction and `.sched2` to confirm the
    initializer order; this is a focused scheduling lever, not a reason to
    rewrite every cursor loop.
  - **At 3+ touched offsets from one base, a walking pointer doesn't just bias
    — it can split into a whole SECOND parallel induction register**, one
    walking pointer materializing a constant offset (e.g. `entry+5`) to serve
    two of the offsets while the original walking pointer serves the third,
    both incrementing by the same stride every iteration (confirmed: every
    walking-pointer spelling tried — plain pointer, byte-cast, named struct
    field — reproduced the identical extra register). The fix is the same
    lever, just needed harder: index by the loop's OWN counter variable
    (`T[i].f`, reusing whatever `int i` already drives the loop-exit test, not
    a separately incremented cursor) so cc1 strength-reduces to exactly ONE
    walking pointer no matter how many offsets/fields you touch off it
    (FUN_8004a6bc's `D_8008E4B4[idx]` table, touched at offsets 0/4/5).
  - **A literal goto backedge can rescue a walking pointer when a field store
    would otherwise become a second GIV.** DoMiscProc's 200-slot cull loop
    touches five fields (`proc`,`x`,`y`,`z`,`pause`) and conditionally calls
    through `proc`.  A genuine pointer loop makes loop.c bias a nonvolatile
    cursor to `pause` at +0x14 (an extra callee-saved induction pointer); a
    pointer-to-volatile suppresses that GIV, but its zero store cannot fill an
    unconditional jump's delay slot, so reorg duplicates the counter increment
    and makes the function one instruction long.  Spell the same scan as a
    hand-rolled label/backedge with a NONVOLATILE walking pointer: the missing
    loop notes suppress strength reduction, while the ordinary `pause = 0`
    remains movable into the jump delay slot.  Cache the other invariant base
    (`view = &ViewInfo`) explicitly when the target keeps it in a saved register.
    This is distinct from an indexed loop: `misc[i].field` created a pointer
    bound test and an extra base copy here, while the goto form retained the
    target's `slti counter,200` plus one 0x24-byte cursor increment.
- **Keep a compared memory read INLINE in both `&&` operands (cc1 CSEs the
  address); hoisting it into a temp can swap two registers.**
  `if (p[n] != K && mx < p[n]) p[n] = mx;` with `mx` declared *before* the `if`
  colours the address into `$v1` and `mx` into `$a1`; rewriting it as
  `cur = p[n]; if (cur != K && mx < cur)` swaps them. autorules and regalloc.py
  both come up empty on this one (no copy-chain, no call) — it is a real 5-byte
  tie the permuter cracks in ~400 iterations (FUN_800568b8). Note the compared
  temp must still be `int`, or a `u8 < u8` compare narrows `slt` to `sltu`.
- **A loop-invariant store value hoists, but its `li` lands AFTER the counter's
  init unless you pre-assign it to a named local before the loop.**
  `for (i=N; i>=0; i--) arr[i].f = -1;` hoists the `-1` yet orders its `li`
  after the counter's — write `s16 dead; dead = -1; for (…) arr[i].f = dead;`
  to emit the invariant's `li` first (leResetEnemyLayout: a 2-instruction pure
  register-swap otherwise).
- **A top-test loop that never hoists its invariants is a hand-rolled goto
  loop, not while(1)+break**: `while(1){if(!cond)break;…}` still emits loop
  notes, so loop.c hoists invariant addresses/constants to the preheader and
  strength-reduces repeated field offsets into a second induction pointer
  (extra callee-saved regs, bigger frame). When the target recomputes an
  invariant `lui`/constant INSIDE the loop and walks ONE cursor with plain
  field offsets, write literal labels:
  `loop: if (!(i < N)) goto end; …; it++; i++; goto loop; end:`
  (ClearItemLayout: while(1)+break gave s0–s4/0x28 frame vs the target's
  s0–s1/0x20; the goto form matched first try).
- **No combined address bases + no rotated tests ⇒ goto loops.** Real
  for/while/do-while get loop.c strength reduction (extra induction pseudos
  folding several field offsets, e.g. base+2/base+6) and jump.c rotation (a
  break test migrating to the bottom with a compensation decrement). A
  hand-rolled `label: ... if (cond) goto label;` keeps one cursor with the
  original displacements and a top test + conditional back-jump
  (GetAreaMapLevel's node walk). Corollary: a TU that divides by a variable
  needs maspsx `--expand-div` for ASPSX's break 7/break 6 guards — per-file,
  via the `extra` list next to maspsxGpExterns in Build.hs (mirrored in
  permute.py MASPSX_EXTRA).
- An induction variable zeroed in a **branch delay slot** of the dispatch
  (`move $s1, $zero` under the `beq`) is just `i = 0;` as the first statement
  of the case body — reorg hoists the target block's head insn into the delay
  slot and retargets the branch.
- **A wrap-around search loop with its increment in the backjump's delay slot
  and an inverse-compensation on the fallthrough exit** is a plain do-while
  with the increment as the FIRST body statement:
  `i = CURR; cur = i; do { i--; if (i < 0) i = 0x19; } while (item[i] == 0 &&
  i != cur);` — reorg steals the top-of-loop `i--` into the conditional
  backjump's slot, retargets the branch to the wrap check, and patches the
  fallthrough exit with `addiu +1` (the entry path falls into the original
  loop top, executing the first decrement for free). Writing the increment
  at the loop *bottom* (`for(;;){...; i--;}`) emits `beq → exit; nop; j top`
  instead — one wasted slot. Load into `i` first then copy to `cur`
  (`i = CURR; cur = i;`) so the lh lands in i's register and the copy is
  `move cur,i`, matching the original operand order (DoInfoViewProc).

- **A `while (1) { … break; }` search loop whose give-up path takes the address
  of a global (`return &dmy;`) gets that `la` hoisted into the preheader by
  loop.c's invariant motion** — the address is loop-invariant, so loop.c lifts
  it above the loop even though the target only materialises it at its own use,
  on the give-up path. There is no source spelling of the loop that suppresses
  this. Hand-roll the loop instead (`top: … goto top;`) so loop.c never sees a
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG` and does no invariant motion at all. Applies even when the
  loop is an otherwise ordinary top-tested pool search (SetFrame/SetSplash/
  SetBleed, the `EffectSlot[200]` scan).

  **But check where the give-up fallback actually lives before reaching for the
  hand-rolled `goto`.** The hazard above exists only when the fallback (`ef = &dmy;`)
  sits *inside* the loop body, giving loop.c an invariant `la` to hoist. When it sits
  *after* the loop — `SetImpact`, `SetExplosion`, same `EffectSlot[200]` pool — there
  is nothing to hoist, and only a genuine bottom-tested `do { … } while (count < 200);`
  reproduces the target's `idx++`/`idx--` delay-slot-steal-and-compensate pattern; the
  hand-rolled `goto` form does not. Two valid shapes, selected by fallback placement:
  do not assume the family's established idiom carries over.

- **You cannot flip a `break`'s branch polarity by negating the test.** `if (c)
  break;` and `if (!c) { … } break;` canonicalise to byte-identical code — cc1's
  break/continue-to-loop-exit machinery erases the difference (verified: the
  rewrite produced a 0-byte diff). The only lever is *where the work lives*: to
  make the `break` the fallthrough rather than the branch-away, move the real
  work for the other case bodily **inside** the `if` block, ahead of the `break`.

- **A bounded scan with an independent terminator can require two literal
  exits in one `while (1)`.** Spell the bound as a top-of-body `if (...) break`,
  perform the body and increment, then spell the data terminator as a second
  `if (...) break` at the bottom. Combining them in the loop condition or
  turning the bottom exit into a `while` test changes the loop notes and which
  edge owns the increment. SetupTelop's glyph scan needed this exact two-break
  shape; use the target's two separately placed back-edge/exit branches as the
  structural tell.

## Expressions

- **A constant right shift can be staged without changing the value.** Under
  this compiler's signed/unsigned shift behavior, `x >> 8` and
  `(x >> 7) >> 1` are equal, but the intermediate RTL lifetime can perturb a
  caller-register allocation cycle. SetupTelop's substantive permuter found
  the 7+1 form as one of only two load-bearing mutations in its best
  exact-length seed. Guided autorules rule `shift-stage` now tries every
  positive two-part split of shifts 2..31 mechanically.
- **Signed fixed-point truncation can require the literal bias-and-shift form.**
  When the target tests a value for negativity, adds `0xfff`, then arithmetic
  shifts by 12, spell that sequence directly:
  `if (x < 0) x += 0xfff; x >>= 12;`. A tidier `/ 0x1000` or folded expression
  can expose a different combine/delay-slot schedule even though it has the
  same truncation-toward-zero result. SetWire needed Ghidra's explicit form to
  remove its final length instruction and expose the target loop schedule;
  verify the raw `bgez`/`addiu 0xfff`/`sra` sequence rather than generalising
  this to every fixed-point divide.
- **fold reassociation** (fold-const.c `associate`/`split_tree`): any
  `A - C + B` or `A + (B - C)` gets its constant migrated between operands.
  `t - 500 + rand() % 1000` reassociates the *wrong* way (constant lands on
  the remainder). Write **`t + (rand() % 1000 - 500)`** — fold canonicalizes
  it into the original's `(t - 500) + rem`. Semantically that's also the
  natural "position + centered jitter".
- **A named typed temp can isolate a centered-modulo tail from its base add.**
  `coord = view + (delta % 6000 - 3000)` and
  `offset = delta % 6000 - 3000; coord = view + offset;` preserve the same
  arithmetic, but the second spelling gives the remainder/bias chain its own
  pseudo and can change only the final add's allocation. In `DrawSnow`,
  the split form cut a 128-byte cascade to 26 bytes without changing length;
  reusing one `u32 offset` across the three non-overlapping coordinate wraps
  kept the modulo type exact. `autorules` rule `mod-bias-temp` now tries both
  a short block-local temp at each safe identifier-only site and one typed temp
  shared across repeated wraps. This is distinct from the rand-call rule below:
  there is no side-effecting call to keep in place.
- Keep calls **inline in expressions**: `x = rand() % 200 - 100;` uses `$v0`
  straight from the call; a temp (`r = rand(); x = r % ...`) inserts a
  `move`. cc1 evaluates the call operand of a binary expression first, so an
  inline call still executes before the other operand's loads.
- **Audit a callee's return width before treating its call-result cascade as
  an allocator-priority problem.**  Think1ninja's callee is independently
  proven `s16 Think1random(void)`.  Declaring it as `s32` created a full-width
  call-result pseudo; CSE propagated that pseudo through the assignment to the
  later narrow return, so it—not the real `s16 result`—crossed three calls and
  took `$s1`.  Correcting the prototype removed the extra global allocno and
  kept `result` in `$s1`.  That made the structurally correct
  `(d2 >= 0) ? d2 : -d2` abssi2 expansion exact instead of triggering a
  33-byte coloring cascade.  A do-while priority boost cannot repair the
  wrong value identity: compare the callee definition/PSX.SYM prototype and
  inspect the call copy chain before weighting either pseudo.
- `%` by a constant compiles to the magic-multiply sequence (`mult`, `mfhi`,
  shift/add chains) — automatic from natural `%`; the *same* magic constant
  shared by several `%`s in range gets CSE'd into one callee-saved register.
- Unsigned halfword loads (`lhu`) mean the field is `u16` even when a
  neighbouring field is `s16` (`life` is `s16`@0x8, `lifemax` is `u16`@0xA).
  Different original TUs can disagree about the same field: the item TU
  `lhu`'s lifemax (u16) but the info-view TU `lh`'s it — keep the shared
  header's proven type and cast at the divergent use
  (`(s16)CamState.Owner->lifemax`, DoInfoViewProc's PutLifeBar call).
  - **But a *narrowing* use reads even a signed-s16 global with `lhu`**: `short
    count = SignedShortGlobal - 1;` loads the global `lhu` (the result truncates
    to 16 bits, so the sign bits are dead), while a *comparison* of the SAME
    signed-s16 global in the same function (`i < SignedShortGlobal`) needs the
    full value and loads `lh` — two un-CSE'd loads of one global, one `lh` one
    `lhu` (different machine modes don't CSE). Don't collapse to one load; give
    the narrowing use its own `short` temp and both loads fall out
    (DeleteConflict's `ConflictObjects`).
- **A copied aggregate can store an unsigned halfword and expose a signed view
  only at its consumer.** If retail reloads the copied field with `lhu` and
  then emits an explicit `sll 16`/`sra 16` at a signed use, declare the field
  `u16` and cast that use to `s16`. Declaring the field `s16` changes the reload
  to `lh` and collapses the visible extension, making an otherwise exact-length
  large function one instruction short. `mission_score_screen`'s packed score
  result is the measured case; the load plus extension proves storage type and
  consumer interpretation independently.
- **An unsigned narrow field with a LATE signed consumer stays in a wide
  working local; put the cast at the consumer, not the load.** If the target
  has `lhu field`, updates that value in a full register, and only then emits
  `sll 16 / sra 16` immediately before a scale/store/call, write
  `s32 yy = node->y; ... yy = yy + slope; wide = (s16)yy * 10;`. Writing
  `yy = (s16)node->y` folds the sign into an `lh`; making `yy` itself `s16`
  lets combine narrow the intermediate arithmetic; and reusing the persistent
  `wide` result as the working value joins two allocnos and rotates the caller
  registers. In `FUN_8002fd9c`, the early-cast/reused-result form was exact
  length but 116 bytes off; a reusable wide `yy` plus separate `height0`/
  `height1` products left only the independent clamp tail. This is a
  producer/consumer data-flow rule, not a blind field retype: preserve the
  proven `u16` field and move the cast to the target's visible extension site.
- **A `u8` local re-narrowed after arithmetic gets a defensive `andi 0xff` +
  unsigned `sltiu`** even when the value provably stays in byte range. If the
  target has a signed `slti` there instead, declare the local `s32` — the source
  `lbu` load already zero-extends so nothing is lost, and cc1 then keeps the
  signed compare with no mask (FUN_800576e8). The same boundary occurs when a
  `u8` field feeds a range guard: copying ProcMiscPitfall's `m->mode` to an
  `int mode` changed `sltiu` to the target's `slti` and improved its final
  residual from 7 to 6 bytes.
- **A boolean flag's declared width (`s16` vs `s32`) changes whether `if (flag)`
  tests it in place or spills through a fresh-register copy — and can shift the
  whole-function instruction count.** When the length is off by a few insns and
  a switch/loop-driven success flag is involved, try flipping its width: a
  `s16` flag matched where `s32` was 4 insns short (handle_char_state_using_item_,
  139→143).
  SearchTarget's `mode = (status in range)` is the large-function version:
  keeping `mode` as `s16` reproduces the repeated promotion/copy chain used by
  its table indexes and comparisons; `s32` coalesces those target-visible
  copies even though the logical value remains 0/1.
  - **A narrow switch guard can also prevent reuse of an SImode case constant.**
    In ActATTACK, `short cleanup_guard` gives each `cleanup_guard = 3` an HImode
    definition. It cannot coalesce with the switch comparison's SImode `3`, so
    reorg duplicates `li 3` into three case-0 branch delay slots before the
    shared `andi`. Declaring the guard `int` reuses the comparison constant and
    loses those target instructions. This is a type-mode decision even though
    every source value fits in either width.
  - **A narrow completion flag can preserve a target-visible copy at its join
    and stop a later call literal from borrowing the flag register.** In
    ActDAMAGE, `short done` produces the retail `move v0,s0` join chain. It also
    keeps `Sound(..., 1)` as a fresh literal instead of reusing the live `s0`
    value; `bool`/`int` coalesces both effects away. Treat the copies and literal
    rematerialisation as one HImode-lifetime clue, not two unrelated register
    accidents.
  - **Mechanized:** `autorules`' default `type-width` rule enumerates the local
    scalar integer widths and signednesses. It deliberately skips pointer,
    array, multi-declarator, and multi-line declarations: changing the shared
    base type in `s16 scalar, *view;` changes memory access width even though
    the first declarator looks scalar. `rtlguide` recommends `type-width` for
    regalloc, CSE, schedule, and length residuals, so this case does not require
    guessing which flag declaration to perturb.
  - **Store-before-sign-extend on a capture-and-increment.** `v = Global; Global
    = v + 1; idx = (short)v;` — the store to `Global` MUST come before the
    `(short)v`. While `v` is still memory-equivalent to `Global`, cse renders
    `(short)v` as a second signed *reload* (`lh Global`) instead of an `sll/sra`
    on the register; the intervening store breaks the equivalence and forces the
    register sign-extend (InsertConflict's slot capture).
- Byte-sized call arguments loaded with `lbu` and no masking are plain `u8`
  struct fields passed directly.
- **A mask literal's SPELLING picks `andi` vs `li`+`and`.** `x & C` is a single
  `andi` only when `C` passes the unsigned-16-bit-immediate test; the *same*
  effective mask written as the complement of a positive constant
  (`~0x5FFF` = 0xFFFFA000, a negative `int`) fails it and materializes a full
  register constant (`addiu $rN,$zero,-0x6000`) + a register-register `and`.
  So `& 0xA000` (andi) and `& ~0x5FFF` (li+and) are bit-identical masks with
  different codegen — read the raw immediate to pick the spelling; don't trust
  Ghidra's positive-literal rendering (Think2confirm's `& ~0x5FFF` vs
  Think1sleep's `& 0xA000`). Corollary: function names here are splat-preserved
  debug symbols describing call-site *intent*, not this function's own control
  flow — `dispose_weapon_data_of_char_` has zero branches (2 stores + a tail
  call, no null-check/free); always read the raw `.s` before assuming a family
  shape from the name.
- **m2c and Ghidra disagree on a call's ARG COUNT in BOTH directions** — m2c
  over-counts (a leftover register at the call site read as an argument),
  Ghidra under-counts (misses stack-passed args past the 4 register ones).
  Count the actual a0-a3 + `sw …,N(sp)`-before-call sets in the raw `.s`
  (Makibishi SoundEx, Ningyo SetNowMotion, Launch SetupFly). m2c *also*
  under-counts in the other direction: a **leading** argument in a register
  carried in live from the caller and never reassigned before the `jal` is
  invisible to m2c (no local def), so it silently drops it — the real call takes
  one more leading arg than m2c shows (DrawBG's `FUN_80063b94`,
  lePackEnemyLayout's `memcpy`/`AdtMessageBox`). Always reconcile against the
  a0–a3 set in the raw `.s`, never m2c's argument list alone. NB this is about
  m2c's rendering of a *call site*, not the callee's own arity: `AdtMessageBox`
  itself is plainly `void AdtMessageBox(char *fmt, ...)`, and all 87 call sites
  already declare it so.
- **A pre-call `sll`/`sra` on an otherwise live argument register proves a
  signed-short formal.** It can simultaneously reveal an argument Ghidra
  omitted: FUN_8005b17c's `$a1` line number is explicitly sign-extended before
  `SetupTelop`, proving the caller-local prototype is
  `SetupTelop(u8 *, short)`, not the one-argument prototype in the old stub.
- **PsyQ `GetTPage` has four full-width `int` arguments; do not redeclare its
  coordinates as `s16` in individual TUs.** A narrow caller-local declaration
  inserts misleading caller-side extensions and can make a register residual
  look like an expression or scheduling problem. `include/psxsdk/libgs.h` is
  the canonical ABI (`s32 tp, s32 abr, s32 x, s32 y`), and the matching-tools
  tests reject TU-local declarations. This is an SDK ABI fact, unlike the
  deliberately caller-local game-function prototypes described below;
  centralising it changed none of the already-matched bytes (SetupTelop and the
  six other callers).
- **An expanded inline helper's pointer parameters can be deliberate CSE
  barriers.** Two direct calls using `&local` let cse carry the same address
  pseudo across both calls. Wrapping them in a small `static inline` helper with
  pointer formals creates parameter bindings during expansion and can force the
  target's fresh local-address formation without moving the aggregate's stack
  slot. FUN_800519bc needed
  `TimToDemoSprite(file, &image, &sprite)` around `GetTIMInfo` + `InitSprite`;
  inspect `.rtl` to confirm the address-pseudo split before introducing such a
  helper, and keep it inside a guarded draft so the asm-stub TU cannot emit an
  unused out-of-line copy.
- **A demo call that disappears in retail may be an INLINE EXPANSION, not
  rewritten source.** When `siblingdiff --demo` shows a named helper call in
  the earlier body but retail contains the helper's instruction shape in its
  place, reconstruct a small local `static __inline__` definition and keep the
  source call.  Hand-copying the helper's logic can lose its expanded parameter
  bindings, return islands, and local identities even when the behavior is
  identical.  AfsFindFile is the measured case: the 300-byte demo calls
  AfsFilenameFix once and subAfsFindFile twice; the 560-byte retail body calls
  neither, while one helper-sized target window contains 12/19 and 27/44 of
  their retail mnemonic bigrams respectively.  A
  hand-expanded draft was 36 bytes short; the two inline calls recovered the
  target CFG and matched in pure C.  `siblingdiff --demo` now reports this only
  when a missing named call has at least six matching helper bigrams and 60%
  helper coverage.  Treat it as a drafting hint and confirm the actual target
  islands—real source edits can also remove calls.
- **An inlined byte-pack helper may need two already-live cursor identities.**
  If the target's two byte loads use different base registers even though one
  cursor is derivable from the other, expose both pointers as helper inputs and
  read the corresponding byte through each input. This preserves the caller's
  distinct pseudos across inline expansion; it can also retain an address-taken
  halfword output store that hand-expanding the expression loses. `AfsGetEntry`
  needed its marker helper to accept both the raw record pointer and the packed
  `raw + 1` cursor: the high byte loads through the former and the low byte
  through the latter in the original. Require those exact load bases in the
  target asm—do not add redundant helper parameters from C semantics alone.
- **One absolute-state pointer reused across distant phases can become an
  unwanted saved-register allocno.** If the target rematerialises the same
  `0x80010000` base with separate `lui` sites but the candidate carries one
  pointer across calls/loops, declare a fresh block-scoped pointer in each
  logical phase. mission_score_screen needed separate initialise, rank-display,
  and table-shift scopes; one function-wide pointer changed the frame and the
  entire saved-register assignment. This is the absolute-address analogue of
  the expanded-inline stack-address barrier above: confirm the retained pseudo
  in `.lreg/.greg`, and confirm target rematerialisation in raw asm before
  splitting scopes.
- **A natural counted loop over stack arrays can hoist their bases and enlarge
  the frame even when the target recomputes each address.** When `.greg` shows
  a loop-invariant `sp+K` address pseudo crossing the loop and occupying a saved
  register/spill slot, a hand-rolled label/back-edge can suppress loop.c's
  invariant treatment while preserving the semantic count. The three-row
  rank loop in mission_score_screen required this to remove an eight-byte late
  spill area and restore the exact `0x1B8` frame. This is justified by the RTL
  allocno plus target `addiu sp,K` rematerialisations—not by frame-size guessing.
- **A second typed byte-offset view can force a fresh stack-array address
  without changing the lvalue.** If `sprite = &bank[i]` remains live but the
  target later recomputes `sp+K + i*sizeof(*bank)` for a final field store,
  writing `bank[i].field` may still CSE back to `sprite->field`. Spell only the
  proven fresh accesses as
  `((T *)((u8 *)bank + i * sizeof(T)))->field`: the value and type stay the
  same, but cc1 creates the target's independent base/index address pseudo.
  `mission_score_screen` needed this for the final `mx/my` writes in both local
  sprite banks; together they restored four target instructions after the
  normal subscript form coalesced them away. Require the raw target's repeated
  `addiu sp,K`/index block before using this—do not turn ordinary subscripts
  into byte arithmetic merely to perturb allocation.
- **Two `u16` out-parameter locals with a 4-byte stack GAP are one `SVECTOR`'s
  `.vx`/`.vz`** (the write skips `.vy`), not two scalars (LightningBolt's
  GetVectorRotation output).
  Related (ReqItemArrow): two adjacent Ghidra-invented `short[2]` out-params of
  one call are really ONE 8-byte stack aggregate — two tight scalars pack 2
  bytes too close, and padding either to 4 overshoots by 4 (non-additive). Use
  one `struct { u16 a, pad0, b, pad1; }` and pass `&s.a`/`&s.b`; read back via
  `lhu` (the callee writes full words, the caller needs each low half).
- **A caller-side extern's RETURN TYPE is an extension-position lever**:
  declaring a u16-returning callee as `extern u32 f()` in the calling TU
  moves the result's derived (s16) extension after the intervening bit-chain,
  reusing the dying result copy (BIS: GetRealPad). Original TUs routinely
  disagree with the defining TU's prototype — respell per-TU, don't "fix"
  the shared header.
- **Two adjacent (s16)→int extensions the target INTERLEAVES**
  ([sll a][sll b][move][sra a][branch][slot: sra b]) can't come from two
  plain assignments (each emits sll+sra adjacent, one scratch serves both).
  Hand-split the halves: `hx = j << 0x10; hy = shown << 0x10; k = cursor;
  ddx = hx >> 0x10; ddy = hy >> 0x10;` — combine collapses
  (sign_extend)<<16 to one sll, the intermediates overlap, reorg steals the
  last sra into the branch slot (BIS cursor move).
- **A constant stored to both a narrow field and a full-word field must be a
  shared int variable**: cc1 gives the literal in `s16_field = 8;` an HImode
  pseudo and a later `s32_field = 8;` a separate SImode one — two `li`s, one
  instruction too long. `m = 8; ... p->pad = m; ... q->mode = m;` yields the
  original's single `li` in one register (the `sh` reads its low part). The
  tell: the same small constant materialized twice, once feeding `sh`, once
  `sw` (ProcItemDrop's conflict-insert path).
  Refinement: the shared-variable tie only forms when the constant feeds
  ARITHMETIC (`item->mode + one`, an `addu` reusing a compare's materialized
  `1`), not when it only feeds stores — plain `sh/sw` of the same literal to
  several fields can reuse the register with NO named C variable
  (Makibishi needed `s32 one=1;`, LightningBolt's store-only case did not).
- **Two constants with the same stored byte can be distinct allocation
  identities at a measured checkpoint.** When the target keeps two long-lived
  constants in different saved registers but cse merges the candidate's
  identical `u8` store values, give one narrow-only source identity a
  byte-equivalent signed value: for example, an `s32 setup = -0x80` assigned
  only to `u8` fields stores the same `0x80` byte as `+0x80`, while remaining a
  different SImode constant for allocation. In `start_demo_`, this separated
  the setup-colour lifetime from the later full-brightness lifetime and
  restored the surrounding saved-register cycle. This is a checkpoint lever,
  not an exact-match endpoint: the materializing immediate still differs
  (`-128` versus `+128`). Prove every consumer narrows to one byte, record the
  residual explicitly, and keep exact byte comparison authoritative.
- **A callee returning a pointer to a small static struct gets a FULL struct
  copy** even when only one field is read afterward: `sr = *(SmallStruct *)
  f();` — align-2 lwl/lwr+swl/swr block copy, not a selective field load
  (debug_menu_stage_option).
- **The countdown-decrement idiom is per-function — decode the raw immediate,
  don't assume.** `count - 1` (real `addiu -1`, tests the NEW value) and
  `count + 0xff` (literal +255, NOT -1, tests the OLD value) both occur for
  lookalike countdown-and-dispose logic (Happou vs LightningBolt). Ghidra's
  `+0xff` is real, not a decompiler artifact — confirm against the encoded word.
- **Keep a narrow countdown field's new value in an `s32` temp when the target
  zero-tests it with raw `sll 16`.** `n = p->count - 1; p->count = n; if
  ((n << 16) == 0)` preserves the unnormalised full-width result long enough for
  the shift test. Re-reading the `u16` field after the store instead naturally
  becomes `lhu`/`andi 0xffff`, a different shape (ProcItemDokudango).
- A two-statement remainder temp (`x = rand(); x = x % 200;`) is provable
  from the asm: the `mult`/`subu` operate **in place on the moved call
  result's register** ($sN) — inline `rand() % 200` computes on `$v0`.
  `autorules` now tries both spellings as `rand-mod` for nonvolatile local
  destinations and literal moduli. In a run of several random components, also
  respect store order: publishing the offset results before an independent
  countdown initializer can let sched fill the target's load/call gaps without
  changing the arithmetic (ProcItemDokudango).
- **Two adjacent call results consumed once by one later call may belong
  directly in that call's argument list.** Separate
  `x = rand(); y = rand(); SetSplash(..., (x&7)<<12, (y&7)<<12, ...);`
  statements finish the first transform before starting the second. Writing
  both `rand()` expressions directly in `SetSplash` lets cc1 keep the first
  masked result across the second `jal` and put its `sll` in that call's delay
  slot—the exact SwimCheck pipeline. `autorules` now performs the paired
  `call-arg-pair` rewrite atomically only for byte-identical producer calls,
  distinct nonvolatile locals with one consumer use each, and no later uses;
  `rtlguide` names the target pattern `call-result-argument-pipeline`.
- **A narrow stepwise remainder/result temp can end a hard-register conflict
  that an `int` temp creates.** In `t = rand() % 25; t -= 26; t -= other / 20`,
  an `int t` is first used as the `/25` quotient while raw rand `$v0` is still
  live, so global allocation forbids `$v0` and prefers `$a1`. Declaring `t` as
  `u8` (the Ghidra-proven type; `s16` happens to generate the same bytes here)
  keeps the quotient in a separate SImode pseudo and defines the narrow result
  only after `$v0` is free. ProcItemNapalm's final 12-byte rotation disappeared
  this way. This is already mechanical: `autorules`' `type-width` rule tests the
  adjacent `s32 -> s16` form and authoritative scoring accepts it.
- **Halfword store constants reveal the element's signedness**: storing an
  0xFFFF terminator emits `li -1` (`addiu $rN,$zero,-1`) only for a SIGNED
  s16 element; a u16 element materializes `ori $rN,$zero,0xffff`. Same
  family: an `x != 0` test on an s16 compiles to `sll`+`beqz` (truncation
  with the sra dropped), on a u16 to `andi 0xffff` — the zero-test names the
  type (PauseProc's cheat buffer is s16). Initializers too: `u16 pad = -1;`
  materializes `ori 0xffff`; only an s16 variable's `= -1` gives the
  `addiu $rN,$zero,-1` form (fold converts the constant through the lvalue's
  type before RTL).
- **An increment shared with a call argument goes through a narrow temp
  BEFORE the call**: `addiu rX,s_i,1; addu s_i,rX; … jal f` (rX caller-saved,
  dead at the call) is `j = i + 1; i = j; f(buf, j + 1);` with `short i, j`.
  Ghidra's rendering (`f(buf, (short)(i+1)+1); i = i + 1;`) would hold the
  shared i+1 across the call — callee-saved reg + post-call move that the
  scheduler never undoes. Narrow (HImode) adds stay raw on the unnormalized
  reg (PauseProc).
- **Share one sign-extended pseudo between a zero-test and a later `& mask` with
  an explicit `int` copy.** Inline `(int)shortvar == 0` compiles to `sll+bnez`
  with the `sra` *elided* (a zero-test doesn't need the low bits), so the
  sign-extended value is never materialized and a following `(int)shortvar &
  mask` re-`and`s the raw copy — the shared pseudo never forms. Write `int io =
  shortvar;` and use `io` in both spots: that forces the `sll+sra` into one
  pseudo (callee-saved if it spans calls) that cse reuses (MoveHumanoid: the
  zero-test and the `& 0xff80` byte-resign share `io` across rsin/rcos).
- **A byte-resign that writes a *different* register than the live param is a
  separate local.** `if ((v & 0xff80) == 0x80) v -= 0x100;` whose `addiu`
  targets a fresh reg (leaving the raw param still live) is `o = v; if (…) o = v
  - 0x100;` — the multiply/store reads `o`; a single reassigned `v` compiles
  in-place. (MoveHumanoid keeps three ordr-derived regs live across the calls:
  the raw param, the `int io` test pseudo, and the `o` corrected copy.)
- **`x = -f(...)` negates at the assignment**, and reorg steals the `negu` into
  a *following* call's delay slot, making `-f` live across that call →
  callee-saved ($s3); a later `y = -g(...)` after the last call stays
  caller-saved ($v1). Keep the negation at the assignment (`s = -rsin(a); c =
  -rcos(a);`), don't write `-(short)s` in the downstream expression and don't
  hoist the sign-fix ahead of it (MoveHumanoid).
- **A conditional negate must re-read its own destination: `x = y; if (cond)
  x = -x;`, not `x = -y;`.** Same value, but `x = -x` picks `negu $rX,$rX`
  (dest = source) while `x = -y` picks `negu $rX,$rY` (a different source
  register) — match only when the negate re-reads the variable it writes
  (Think1trace).
- **A conditional value used ONLY as a call argument is an inline ternary, not
  a preceding if/else.** Ghidra renders `f(…, cond ? B : A)` as an SSA artifact
  `tmp = A; if (cond) tmp = B; f(…, tmp);` — but written as separate statements
  the conditional gets its own basic block that strictly precedes (blocks)
  evaluation of the call's OTHER arguments, so sched1 can't interleave the flag
  computation with them. Spell it as the ternary directly (SetupSoundEffect: a
  48-byte residual fixed in one edit).
- **Two registers holding the same computed value = an explicit source
  copy**: cc1 never splits live ranges — `trg = cur & (cur ^ opad);` into
  one callee-saved reg and then `opad = trg;` into another, with the rest of
  the body reading `opad`, is the only way one value occupies two s-regs
  (PauseProc).
  SearchTarget needed this across an arithmetic/stack join: update `delta_y`,
  copy the resulting height into a separate `base_y`, store it to
  `delta.vy`, and derive the later adjusted height from `base_y`. Reusing one
  scalar collapses the target's `$v1`→`$a1` copy and renumbers the following
  normalization loop.
  - **Branch variant — a second pointer feeds the guard-branch delay slot.**
    When one branch of an `if` reads a pointer/value the other computes, and the
    target combines the address *eagerly* (before the guard-flag load) with an
    explicit register copy hoisted into the guard branch's delay slot: declare
    the copy `q = p;` right after computing `p` and before the `if`, then read
    `p` in one branch and `q` in the other. This forces the full address combine
    at that statement (instead of drifting into the delay slot) AND supplies the
    move reorg steals into the branch's delay slot (PadShock).
  - **Loop-exit variant — place a tested-value copy before the break guard to
    change its allocno home.** `exit = value; if (value & MASK) break;` and
    `if (value & MASK) { exit = value; break; }` can schedule the same move in
    the guard branch's delay slot and retain identical CFG, length, and calls,
    yet the earlier definition has a different live range/reference priority.
    In `debug_menu_player_jump`, the arm-local form was an exact-length,
    two-byte register residual (`move v0,v1` and a later test from `v0` where
    the target used `a0`); the pre-guard form byte-matched all 692 bytes.
    Guided `autorules` exposes both placements as `guard-exit-copy`, restricted
    to a simple nonvolatile copy, a pure condition, the loop's unique break,
    and no other in-loop use of the destination. This is a late allocation
    lever: first prove the copy/test chain with `rtlguide`, then score it.
- **Ghidra's short-typed call-result variable can be `int` in source**: a
  short-returning call assigned to int extends once at the assignment
  (sll/sra right after the jal, before any joins); a true `short` variable
  re-extends at each compare after the joins. Place the sll/sra relative to
  the joins to pick the type (PauseProc). Corollary: a short-returning call
  whose result INDEXES an array (`n = InsertConflict(...); D_800BC108[n]…`)
  wants `s32 n`, not `s16` — s16 lets the sign-extend float to the use and
  interleave with the `&arr` address calc (16-byte residual); s32 pins it at
  the assignment (Makibishi/LightningBolt).
- **Ghidra can mistype a stack-passed *parameter*'s width — cross-check m2c's
  per-register typing.** Two tells that Ghidra's narrow guess is wrong and the
  full register width is really used:
  - a full `lw` + `sll`/`sra` re-widen of a parameter used/narrowed exactly once
    with no other reference — a genuinely-`int` parameter merely narrowed for a
    callee's `short` formal instead folds to a single `lh` (cc1/combine reads
    "load then keep the low 16 bits" of a plain memory operand as one
    instruction; a local copy does NOT defeat the fold — copy-propagation erases
    the temp first). Declare the real width: SetLightning's 5th param was
    Ghidra-typed `int b` (rendered `(int)(short)b`) but is actually `short b`.
  - Ghidra spelling the parameter `CONCAT22(in_register_XXXX, narrow_var)` — the
    decompiler admitting its own narrow guess is wrong (the full register width
    is used); the real type is the wide one (PutItemCursor's `rotdif`: Ghidra
    `short`, really `s32`). m2c's per-register width inference is the tiebreaker,
    together with the absence of widen instructions before the arithmetic use.
  - **The same trap applies to register-passed coordinates used only by narrow
    stores.** A decompiler (and even m2c) may call `$a2/$a3` `short` merely
    because every visible destination is `sh`. If retail immediately copies
    each incoming register to a long-lived `$sN` with a raw `move` and never
    performs an entry `sll/sra`, test full-width parameters. In
    `FUN_800515b0`, changing both apparent `short x, short y` coordinates to
    `s32` changed no arithmetic or stores, but removed the final 22-byte split
    identity (early `$a2/$a3` uses versus later `$s7/$s6`) and matched all
    1,036 bytes. Autorules `param-width` now enumerates plain integer parameter
    widths and signedness mechanically.
  - **The target stack load is direct parameter-width evidence, even when the
    earlier-build symbol prototype disagrees.** Retail SetSmokeS loads its fifth
    argument with `lhu stack+16`, proving `unsigned short time` despite the demo
    PSX.SYM prototype's `int time`. The function still needs signed division:
    keep the raw `u16` parameter for its narrow store, then use a separately
    timed full-width host, `int t; ... t = (short)time;`, for `/` and `%`. That
    combination preserves the entry/load mode, the raw stored bits, the signed
    ASPSX division guards, and the target's two-instruction sign extension.
    `param-width` now tries adjacent width+signedness changes atomically, so
    `int`→`u16` does not depend on a score-improving `int`→`short` intermediate;
    choosing which later uses need the signed host remains dataflow-guided.
- **A param-union write to OFFSET 0 routes through a fresh `it->param` recast,
  nonzero offsets through the live `pp` pointer** — mechanical, not stylistic:
  `pp` holds its own register so `pp+0` encodes `sw rN,0(pp)`, but a fresh
  `((T *)it->param)` recast folds the constant offset into `it`'s register
  (`sw rN,0x20(it)`) — same address, different bytes. Extends the twins'
  `hint = 0` single-field case; ReqItemKaengeki does it for a whole 6-word
  tail (p->start/p->end stored as raw s32 at it->param 0/4/8/0x10/0x14/0x18,
  each an isolated lw+sw, no temps). The divergent member can also sit at
  offsets that don't line up with the named view AT ALL (ReqItemGoshikimai:
  three u16 at it->param 0/2/4, no hint/status/count) — `pp` is still declared
  before the null check (the delay-slot lever) even when NONE of its named
  fields are read, purely as a cast vehicle.
- **A param-union store whose access WIDTH differs from the proven shared
  view at the same offset is a distinct union member** — reach it via an
  explicit offset cast off the SAME proven pointer
  (`*(s32 *)((u8 *)pp + 0xC) = 0;`), don't invent a new named struct. Ghidra
  synthesizes a different, often bogus union path per such store
  (ReqItemDokudango got four: napalm/smoke.koro/lightningbolt/gun — cross-
  function unification noise), and NEITHER Ghidra nor m2c discloses the store
  width; only the raw `.s` mnemonic (sw/sh/sb) does. `tools/access.py <Name>`
  prints each pointer offset's width/direction so you don't hand-trace it.
- **A narrowing store fed through a temp forces the full-word load**:
  `x = p->end.vx; pp->vx = x;` gives the original's `lw` + `sh`, while the
  inline `pp->vx = p->end.vx;` lets the canonical cc1 emit a truncating `lhu`
  of the low half. Loads batched before a run of stores (`lw`×3 then `sh`×3)
  mean the values went through source temps. **The stores need NOT stay
  contiguous**: the tell is just "N loads adjacent with no use between them"
  — name them as temps even if the scheduler later scatters their stores
  (ReqItemJirai: `p->user`/`p->type` load back-to-back but their
  `it->owner=`/`it->type=` stores end up 4 insns apart with other stores
  interleaved; `us = p->user; ty = p->type;` then the stores matched, while
  inline loads cost 26 bytes).

**`x & (1 << n)` for non-constant `n` always canonicalises to `(x >> n) & 1`**
(`srav`+`andi`), never the literal `sllv`+`and` — verified standalone against the
pinned cc1. If the target has the literal shape, name the shifted mask first:
`int mask = 1 << n; if (x & mask)`.

**A `<<2` scaling of a truncated difference must be a separately-reused variable's
own second use**, or fpeephole fuses the truncating `sra` and the shift into one
instruction — leaving you one instruction short of the target.

**Increment-first beats read-one-ahead, even for a plain forward scan.**
`while (pad != -1) { point++; pad = point->pad; }` is two instructions shorter than
`while (pad != -1) { pad = point[1].pad; point++; }` — the one-ahead form needs a
`+12`/`-12` compensation pair the increment-first form never creates
(`SetupTraceLine`).

**A narrow (`short`) accumulator can be right for an arithmetic ladder whose value is
only narrowed at the end.** `short t` rather than `s32 t` removed both a spurious
`andi 0xffff` and a whole register-allocation cascade in `ControlTraceLine`'s degree
ladder.

**A short moved into the high half has two useful source spellings.** For a
declared 16-bit value, `(u16)x << 16` and `x * 0x10000` can both reach the raw
`sll`, while extra outer casts or signed shift-and-extend spellings introduce
`andi` or `sll/sra` canonicalization. They are not interchangeable once nearby
assignments and signed tests enter CSE, so score both at the exact site the RTL
maps. Guided `autorules` exposes the casted-shift→multiply spelling as
`shift16-mul`; DamageControl needs both shapes on different paths.

**A field compared then re-read inside the hit body wants a named temp captured via a
comma expression, to preserve `&&` short-circuit.** `if (cond && (z = lv.vz, z < dist))
{ dist = z; … }` gives both the short-circuit AND one load: a bare re-read
(`… && lv.vz < dist; … dist = lv.vz;`) forces a second stack reload (the `slt` clobbers
the compare's register), and an unconditional `z = lv.vz;` before the `if` reads the
field even when `cond` is false (2 extra insns). Only the assignment INSIDE the RHS
operand gives both (`SearchItemTarget2`; and its hit body's `dist = z;` must precede the
struct copy `*target = tv;`, or the copy's temps schedule first and swap a move pair).

**A callee that really returns `s16` can be declared `extern u16 f()` per-TU so the
caller tests its sign as `(f() << 16) < 0`.** u16 promotes to int, so bit 15 lands in
bit 31 for a plain `sll`+`bltz` with no `sra` (the shifted value is never reused). Same
per-TU return-type lever as GetRealPad, here applied to GetMotionID's not-found
sentinel (`JumpControl`).

**The EffectSlot pool-scan `slot = base + idx` addu is index-first ONLY without an
outer loop.** Single-shot spawners (SetImpact/SetExplosion/SetBleed) emit it index-first
(`addu dst, scaled_idx, base`). The moment the same expression runs inside an outer
count loop with `base` loop-invariant callee-saved, cc1 canonicalises the invariant
operand FIRST (`addu dst, base, scaled_idx`) — a post-`fold` RTL operand order with NO
source lever: `base+idx`, `idx+base`, `&base[idx]` all fold identical, and moving `base`
in/out of the loop changes the LENGTH instead. A 1-instruction, same-length,
permuter-immune sub-C tie (SetBlood, SetHinoko). For such an outer-loop spawner, use
`while (1) { if (!(i < n)) break; …; i++; }` (NOT a hand-rolled goto) to place `base` in
the target's callee-saved register — SetHinoko's goto form shifted every param register
up one (55-byte cascade); the while/break form collapsed it to the 2-byte addu tie.

**`a - (C - b)` and `a - (b - C)` survive fold; `a - C + b` gets reassociated.**
split_tree builds `a - (C - b)` as `(a - C) + b` and `a - (b - C)` as `(a + C) - b`
(it builds, does not refold), so the constant folds into an existing operand. The naive
`a - C + b` is reassociated to `a + (b - C)`, whose `b - C` is an INDEPENDENT instruction
that drifts into a delay slot — one off. Spell the subtraction with the parenthesised
`C - b` / `b - C` grouping the target's `addiu`+`addu`/`subu` pair implies (`HangCheck`:
`dtL->vy - (0x69 - y)` → `addiu vy,-105; addu +y`).

**Two loop-invariant, mutually-independent assignments that must land in a specific
relative order: cc1's list scheduler breaks the tie by RTL-creation (UID) order, which
follows source scan order.** To force one earlier, capture whichever must come first as
an explicit statement before the other — hoisting a dispatch comparison into an
unconditional boolean, `found = (a == b); k = 1; if (found) …`, gives the comparison's
widen (`sll/sra`) a lower UID than `k = 1`, ordering it first. Zero semantic effect, pure
UID control (`SetCommand`). Related loop lever: the bottom `i++` must be the LAST body
statement (after the whole `if`), so reorg hoists it into the entry-comparison branch's
delay slot.

**An address-taken local's loads never schedule above ANY pointer store** (the scheduler
is alias-conservative: a true dep to every store). If the target reads such a local
BETWEEN two field stores, the source statement order put that read earlier — reorder the
STATEMENTS, do not chase the scheduler (`HangCheck`'s vx/vz-then-vy commit order: `vect`
escaped, so its `lh` reads carry deps on every earlier `*dtL` store, and storing vy last
lets the vz read fill the load-delay hole with no hazard nop).

**A variable that reads a struct field ONLY within one conditional arm and writes it back
at the arm's end should be scoped LOCAL to that arm, not hoisted to function scope.**
Ghidra's early top-of-function `uVar1 = field;` is frequently an SSA-placement artifact,
not true source position -- rescoping it into the arm fixed PutStrain's length exactly
(`NumberImage.u` was read only in the digit-loop branch, not globally).

**When a named global pointer fuses away a target address copy, make the first access a
direct field operation and name the pointer second.** `NumberImage.w = 4; img =
&NumberImage;` creates a caller-register address pseudo and then the target's separate
copy into `img`'s saved register; `img = &NumberImage; img->w = 4;` lets cc1 form the
address directly in the saved register and is one instruction short. Keep later field
reads through `img` when the target does: changing PutStrain's later `base = img->u` to
a direct global read moved the load above four independent sprite stores. This completed
PutStrain's exact 584-byte match after a call-site loop-depth fence had already recovered
the `base`/`spr` saved-register order.

**A comma-expression initializer can make independent table loads precede a global
pointer capture without adding code.** In PutLifeBar, spelling the width write as
`NumberImage.w = (dx = style.dx, dy = style.dy, 4); img = &NumberImage;` gave the two
style-field loads earlier RTL UIDs while retaining the target's separate global-address
copy into `img`. Plain sequential assignments either scheduled the width store too early
or fused the address directly into the saved register.

**When a result must reuse its test register, reuse the result local as the test
carrier.** In PutLifeBar, the separate `GameClock & 1` comparison pseudo hard-conflicted
with `color` and forced the otherwise exact colour tail into `$v1`. Writing
`color = GameClock & 1; if (color != 0) color = 0xE6; else color = 0x80;` inside the
outer arm gives `color` a `$v0` preference and emits the target's `bnez` with `0xE6` in
its delay slot plus the fallback `0x80` immediately after it. The eliminated identical-
arm fence around the final colour store still supplies the independent saved-register
allocation donor.

**End a loop temporary's source scope before testing its copied working value when CSE
chooses the wrong equivalent register.** PutLifeBar's digit quotient lives in a nested
block containing the goto label and `t = q`; the block ends before `if (t != 0) goto
loop`. That scope-end note makes CSE retain the backedge test of copied `t` in `$a3`
instead of substituting the equivalent quotient `q` in `$s0`, resolving a final
two-byte operand residual with no code. Jumping back into the block is safe only when
the local is an ordinary scalar assigned before every use (no initializer or VLA).

**`x++` (postfix) is the general spelling for "test the OLD value; the incremented value
is stored unconditionally because the other path overwrites it anyway."**
`if (field++ < K) return; field = 0;` reproduces a single-load + delay-slot-store shape;
an intermediate temp (`v = field; if (v < K) field = v+1;`) sometimes fails to reach the
fused form.

**A captured field copy used later in arithmetic must be declared `s32`, not the field's
narrow width.** `s16 size = param->size;` triggers cc1's narrowing-store-loads-`lhu` rule
even when `size` is later used in signed arithmetic, costing a spurious `sll/sra`
re-widen. Declare the capturing local `s32` (`DrawFrame`'s size, `DrawSmoke`'s vz_old).

**Pointer arithmetic normalises to base+index; only INTEGER addition keeps operand
order.** `p = (SVECTOR *)(idx * 0x20 + (s32)tbl);` emits `addu p,index,base`, whereas
`tbl[i]`, `&tbl[i][0]` and `(u8 *)tbl + n` all emit `addu p,base,index`. When the
target's `addu` has the index first, spell the address as an explicit integer sum,
not an array subscript (`SetCameraMode`). `ptr-index-sum` now handles both a
pointer declaration initializer and a later bare assignment, including `T **`:
DrawConstruction's `slot = DrawList + bucket` needed
`slot = (T **)((u32)DrawList + bucket * sizeof(*slot))` for the terminal
index-first `addu`.

If the target completes a narrow index's sign-extension/scale before it starts an
independent `%hi`/`%lo` base materialization, name the scaled byte offset in its own
`s32` statement before the integer pointer sum. An inline
`(s16)i * 4 + (s32)table` can still let sched1 interleave the table `lui/addiu`
between the `sll` and `sra`; `offset = (s16)i * 4; *(T **)(offset +
(s32)table) = value;` keeps the conversion chain together without extra code
(`UpdateEvent`).

**Naming an extern array base before indexing is a separate scheduling lever.**
`T *stage = &StageConfig[StageNo]` and
`T *base = StageConfig; stage = &base[StageNo]` preserve base-first pointer
arithmetic but give split-addresses/CSE a distinct base pseudo and earlier UID.
CreateStage needed the second spelling for its first scheduling block. Guided
autorules rule `ptr-base-split` now enumerates it for pointer declaration
initializers over an identifier array base.

**Independent row and element scaling identifies a multidimensional table, not
a flattened array.** If retail emits `row << log2(row_bytes)`, separately emits
`column << log2(element_bytes)`, and only then adds the two offsets, declare the
extern with its real second dimension and use `table[row][column]`. A flattened
`table[row * columns + column]` lets fold combine the indices before the final
element-size shift, often changing both the instruction order and every scratch
register in the address block. `think_setting_small_rotation_small_steps_`
needed `s16 AIDHumanType[][2]` to turn a 23-byte residual into a five-byte
sub-C-level phi tie while preserving the exact 1,392-byte function length.
`rtlguide` now names that final shape `branch-phi-register-tie` and puts the
arm/writeback rules ahead of generic liveness experiments.

**Build a dynamic row base before a large constant field displacement.** For a
flattened table, `state->stock[chr * stride + field]` encourages cc1 to add the
constant into the dynamic index first, then address the struct base. If retail
uses the large field displacement directly on a register, first spell
`row = (u8 *)state + chr * stride; value = row[field];`. FUN_80052ea8 needed
this shape to produce the folded `0x41f(row)` access instead of an extra
`addiu` followed by `0x40c(base)`.

**A `slti/xori/bnez` (set-condition + branch) success test is a NAMED flag variable.**
`hitf = call(...) > 0x7ff; if (hitf) goto hit;` compiles the three-instruction
scc+branch; the inline `if (call(...) > 0x7ff)` compiles a two-instruction
`slti/beqz` and is one short (`SetCameraMode`).

**Serialised stores/loads at absolute scratchpad addresses are small-extern SYMBOL
accesses, not flat pointer casts.** A `<= -G8` extern's store is the one-op `$at`
macro AND is `MEM_IN_STRUCT_P`; gcc 2.8.1 `sched.c`'s `true_dependence` MEM-in-struct
heuristic then dismisses the store→load dependence between a non-struct fixed-address
store and a struct varying-address load, so a flat `*(s16 *)0x1F8000xx` cast lets
sched1 wrongly batch the following struct loads past the stores, while a
struct-pointer cast loses the constant-address macro (base forced into a register).
Bind the symbol in `config/symbols.<target>.txt` and access it as a plain extern; GTE
CALL arguments, by contrast, stay literal casts (`SetCameraMode`'s scratchpad
rot/trans tables). **cse.c shares the same `MEM_IN_STRUCT_P` alias heuristic**:
a varying-address struct-member store (`dtV->vy = -0x23;`) does NOT invalidate
the cached load of a fixed-address non-struct scalar global (`lw gp(dtM)`), so a
following `dtM->count` re-read reuses the register with no reload — only a
multi-predecessor label forces a fresh gp load. This is exactly *when* the
d-globals reload across the `Act*` family (ActHANG case 4's no-reload vs
ActSYURI's reload after the `.L80025E68` join).

**A same-width scalar alias can deliberately clear a captured member load's
`MEM_IN_STRUCT_P` marker.** On the 32-bit PS1 ABI, `long y; y = p->field;`
and `y = *(s32 *)&p->field;` read the same signed 32-bit representation, but
old cc1 gives only the direct member spelling the structure-memory marker. CSE
can therefore delete or sink a one-use direct load across fixed-address
non-struct stores and collapse its hard-register lifetime; the scalar-lvalue
spelling keeps an early independent load live. In `DrawSplash`, plain `py/pz`
captures left a 51-byte residual, while the two aliases preserved retail's
early `a1/a2` loads and matched exactly; `px` needed no alias because it was
consumed before those stores. Use this only when `.rtl` creates the expected
locals, `.cse` is the pass that deletes/sinks them, and retail retains the early
loads. Guided aggressive autorules rule `member-scalar-alias` enumerates the
pure-C toggle and adjacent same-object pairs atomically (either alias alone
worsened `DrawSplash`). This is a matching lever for the old compiler and known
field layout, not a general strict-aliasing recommendation for modern C.

**Two divisions in one function must be computed back-to-back before either's store
block.** Interleaving store-then-next-division puts stores BETWEEN two reads of the same
field, invalidating cse1's cached load and forcing a needless reload+move
(`UpdateSplineControl`; matches Ghidra's literal order). And a store destined for a
branch's delay slot must be written BEFORE the load whose result feeds the next test --
an intervening store between a load and its first use blocks combine from fusing
`lhu`+sign-extend into `lh` (`AttackContinuousCheck`).

**An expanded division physically before a flag branch belongs before that guard in
C too.** PadProc's retail code executes both rumble-envelope divisions before testing
the shock-enable byte. Leaving `ct / attack` or `ct / release` only in the enabled
store arm changed the behavior, let cc1 cross-jump the disabled tails, and left the
draft one instruction short. Compute the quotient first, spell the enabled arm as the
fallthrough, and use separate branch-scoped output-base pointers when retail retains
distinct address pseudos. That combination restored PadProc's exact 368-byte extent
and first moved its guarded residual from a non-authoritative 364-byte carve to 172
linked bytes.

**An identical-arm capture fence can stage address and flag identities between a
multiply and its expanded division without leaving a branch in the output.** Give
the numerator a named `product`; in both arms of a condition on that product, assign
the same output-base pointer and flag snapshot; then divide the product into the real
result. The early CFG keeps the numerator, base and flag as separate pseudos, while
`jump2` later deletes the identical condition. PadProc needed this in both envelope
arms, plus a cached release divisor across the join: re-reading the member after the
fence added a fresh base/load/nop triplet. Layering two smaller allocation donors on
the attack arm reduced its exact-length residual from 172 to 43 bytes. This is safe
only when both arms are genuinely identical and the tested expression is already
evaluated on every path.

**A branch-proven scalar can distinguish otherwise cross-jumpable store tails while
still compiling to the zero register.** In PadProc's disabled attack arm, assigning
the tested `int shock` to both motor bytes is equivalent to assigning zero because
that arm is reached only when `shock == 0`. The distinct value identity stops the old
jump pass from merging this tail with the release-disabled stores; combine still
emits `sb zero` for both writes. An `u8 shock` kept the hard register in the stores,
whereas the promoted `int` form produced the target zero-register stores and cut the
residual to 41 bytes. Require an immediately dominating equality test before using
this lever; otherwise it changes behavior.

**Per-address PSX.SYM line events can distinguish a compound expression from
adjacent statements when the disassembly alone cannot.** PadProc's demo line map
assigns its negate/increment sequence to original line 257 and the following attack
add to line 258. That evidence selects `ct = -PadArrange.time++;` followed by
`ct += attack`, rather than three separately written load/negate/increment
statements. With the same semantics and exact extent, the compound spelling emits
retail's `negu; addiu; addu` ordering and reduced PadProc's linked residual from 41
to 30 bytes. Use this only when the PSX.SYM build and a shipping/demo executable
agree on the instruction-to-line boundary; line tables still describe an earlier
build and are not retail source text.

**Several divisions by the SAME runtime divisor compile eagerly, back-to-back,
before any intervening call** — even where Ghidra renders one lazily folded into a
later call's argument (`f(a, b / d)`). `IsVisible`'s three divisions by one variable
`d` all execute before either `abs()` that consumes them. Give each quotient its own
named temp and compute them all, in argument order, before the first consuming call.

**Expanded variable divisions feeding adjacent narrow fields may need grouped
quotient temps before any store.** The target tell is several guarded `divu`/`mflo`
pairs followed by one contiguous `sb`/`sh` block. Preserve that dataflow literally:
compute every channel into a scalar local, then assign the fields together. Direct
`field = numerator / divisor` statements consume each quotient immediately and can
make maspsx retain an extra hazard `nop` around every expanded division. The A/B in
`FUN_80036284` was exact and large enough to diagnose mechanically: two three-channel
fade arms written directly were 752 bytes versus the 728-byte target (six extra
instructions); grouped quotient locals restored 728 bytes, the target stack layout,
and the contiguous color stores. Apply this only when the target itself groups the
stores; an interleaved target still calls for interleaved source.

**A target's "redundant-looking" extra reload means the source used a fresh field
dereference, not a cached pointer.** `vrealloc` writes `vh.next = vhp->next;` even
though a `nb` variable computed moments earlier holds the numerically identical
address; spelling it `vh.next = nb;` drops the reload the target has, because cc1
will not refetch what it can already see live in a register. Provable equality is not
a licence to reuse the variable.

**A short-lived pointer-to-volatile scalar can preserve a second signed/unsigned
view and its derived base.** `volatile u16 *stg_think = &stg->think;` forces a
later `*stg_think` to remain a real halfword load. In StartStageSequence this
prevented CSE from replacing the second read with the earlier chrid value and
made its address reuse the target's derived `$s1-10` base rather than rebuild
`$s2+2`; a nonvolatile pointer deleted the load. Guided autorules now toggles
this local pointee qualifier as `pointee-volatile`, restricted to plain integer
pointer declarations. Treat a winning volatile view as evidence that the
original source required distinct accesses, and keep it site-local.

**A site-local volatile view of a pointer-array SLOT can force a fresh pointer
reload without making the pointed-to object volatile.** When the target reloads
`Objects[i]`, pays the load-delay `nop`, and only then reads a field—even though no
call or visible store invalidates cc1's earlier pointer—spell just that access as
`(*(Object *volatile *)&Objects[i])->field`. The `volatile` qualifier belongs to
the pointer object stored in the array slot, not to `Object`, and must not be added
to the shared extern declaration. This closed `UpdateEvent`'s exact two-instruction
gap; use it only when the raw target proves the redundant slot reload.

**A `volatile` local added as a matching hack also inserts a scheduling barrier
at every access — and that barrier itself can BE the residual.** If the barrier
sits at the local's initialization before an early call (e.g.
`volatile u16 old_pad; old_pad = 0;` preceding the first call), it can pin a
following argument-constant load below the prologue register-save block, showing
up as a whole-prologue rotation (every save appears shifted by one). If the
target hoists that constant up into the saves, make the local **non-volatile** —
cc1 can then schedule the register-only load across the now-ordinary store, and
non-volatile is usually the correct semantics anyway. (start_demo_: closed the
entire prologue `li a1,-1` cluster, 98→75.) The audit direction: every
`volatile` in a draft is a barrier at each of its accesses; when a residual
block ROTATES around one, suspect the qualifier before the schedule.

**Corroborate an otherwise dead target load in another shipped build before
encoding it.** A load whose result is never consumed can be a real volatile-style
source access, but it can also be a bad carve, alignment artefact, or mistaken
interpretation. ActATTACK has the same dead `Me_MOTION_C` load immediately before
the root-model coordinate clears in both retail and trial executables. That
independent occurrence justifies the narrow, site-local spelling
`(void)*(Humanoid * volatile *)&Me_MOTION_C;`; do not make the shared declaration
globally volatile. Without cross-build or surrounding-RTL corroboration, do not
invent a dead read merely to fill four bytes. This remains a review rule rather
than an automatic mutation.

**A value used ONLY as a conditional call argument must be the inline ternary in the
call's argument position**, not assigned to a named local first (even via a ternary).
Assigning it first makes cc1 re-read the tested field a second time, with the wrong
signedness -- three extra instructions in `AVCameraSetup`'s `ordr`.

**A comparison's operand order is an instruction-order lever, not a sched tie.**
expand evaluates op0 first, so `found > mem` emits the (short) sign-extension `sll`s
BEFORE the `lh`, while `mem < found` loads first — same `slt` either way. Order the
comparison to match which side's evaluation the target front-loads (`GetConflictResult`,
8 bytes).

**Equivalent local-vs-local comparison polarity is a register-allocation lever.**
Even when `direction < turn` and `turn > direction` lower to the same `slt`, fold
creates/references the operand pseudos in the opposite order. In ActATTACK that
alone exchanged the `$v1`/`$a1` homes used by the surrounding turn logic; no
instruction shape changed. This is distinct from the memory/local rule above:
`cmp-swap` handles evaluation order when exactly one operand is a dereference,
while guided `cmp-polarity` enumerates nonliteral local/local comparisons near a
register or scheduling residual.

**Put a pointer-field publish (`Global = p->field;`) FIRST in a multi-field store
group.** sched1 then sinks its `lw`/`sw` into the following pairs' load-delay slots one
group at a time; placing it mid-group leaves a `nop` in the first slot and drags the
`sw` below the next `subu` (`GetConflictResult`; made an old `do{}while(0)` hack
unnecessary).

**Two stores of the same struct field to DIFFERENT objects, even with zero
intervening statements, need a named temp for a single shared load** — if the struct's
address has already escaped (passed to a callee earlier), cc1 stops CSEing repeat reads
of it even across adjacent statements. `sx = out.vx; sp2->x = sx; sp1->x = sx;`
(`FUN_80039fb0`). The clamp counterpart: a clamp's final expression must re-read the
struct field directly (`scr.vz`) rather than reuse an already-live local, because the
target's asm shows a fresh `lh` reload there even at a numerically-identical value
(`FUN_8003a148`).

**Ghidra's own SSA rendering tells you when the target reloads.** If Ghidra shows a
second, separately-named dereference of an address instead of reusing its earlier
temp, the target really does refetch: reusing your cached local there costs an
instruction (`CVArun`'s `GsSortSprite` re-read, `CVAsetup`'s post-loop nudge). This
is the Ghidra-side tell for the `vrealloc` fresh-field-dereference rule above.

**`GsSortSprite`'s `int pri` argument needs an explicit `(u16)` cast at the call
site** to reproduce the `andi $a2,$a2,0xffff` that sits in the `jal`'s delay slot.

**A pure narrowing struct-field copy uses `lhu`/`lbu` even for signed fields.** A
field read and immediately written back at the same width, with no arithmetic in
between, loads unsigned regardless of the field's signedness — the sign bits can't
matter. Do not fight it with named temps or casts.

## Stack objects

**Declaration order can control separately-declared same-type address-taken stack
objects' slots; do not assume reference order controls them.** `leLayoutEnemy`
provides a one-change A/B: keeping all references fixed while swapping only
`VECTOR tmp; VECTOR pos;` to `VECTOR pos; VECTOR tmp;` swapped every
`sp+24`/`sp+40` access and caused 26 byte differences. The matching order declares
`tmp` first (the later `SetBleeds` argument at `sp+24`) and `pos` second (the earlier
memset scratch at `sp+40`), so reference order does not determine these slots here.
`autorules`' ordinary `stack-decl-swap` candidate enumerates this exact bounded lever
for adjacent, uninitialized, same-typedef objects whose addresses are both taken.

**cc1 pads EACH separately-declared aggregate stack local up to a multiple of 8
bytes.** Four adjacent aggregates that were really contiguous fields of one original
struct must be declared as ONE combined struct local, or each is individually
rounded (`DRAWENV` 0x5c → 0x60, `DISPENV` 0x14 → 0x18), inflating the frame and
shifting every later offset — even though each was already 4-byte aligned. Field
offsets *inside* one struct follow plain member alignment, with no such rounding
(`AdtMessageBox`).

**A varargs argument pointer must be computed lazily, at the call.** Writing
`s32 *args = (s32 *)((char *)&fmt + sizeof(fmt));` as a named local at function
entry forces cc1 to hold the address in a callee-saved register across the whole
function when the vararg call is far away — an extra register and 8 bytes of frame.
Inline the expression at the call site instead and cc1 computes it with a
caller-saved temp. (`FUN_8005fe38` wants the named-local form because its call is
near entry; `AdtMessageBox` wants the inline form.)

- When Ghidra shows **overlapping stack locals** (its `local_40`-style merged
  buffer), the original really used **one `u8 buf[N]` + casts**
  (`(PARAM_ITEM_USE *)buf`, `*(VECTOR *)(buf + 0x10)`, ...). cc1 2.8 does
  **not** share stack slots between sibling scopes, so distinct scoped locals
  can't reproduce the overlap.
  Large file-format buffers follow the same rule: `LoadCard` and `SaveCard`
  each have one `u8 block[0x2000]` at sp+0xe0, with the 0x200-byte card header
  and payload represented by typed casts into that buffer. Ghidra's several
  arrays are views, not separately allocated objects.
  Conversely, three scalar deltas are sometimes one real `VECTOR` stack
  local even when each component appears independently in Ghidra. SearchTarget
  only recovered its exact 0x50 frame and sp+0x10 access plan with one `VECTOR
  delta`; separate scalars colored into saved registers and erased the retail
  workspace. `register_character_death` independently confirms the stronger
  stack signature: `lw/sw` at sp+0x10/0x14/0x18 followed by an address-taken
  `SVECTOR` at sp+0x20 is `VECTOR delta; SVECTOR passage;`. The aggregate form
  collapsed an s0-s6 scalar allocation to the target's s0-s2 and matched all
  820 bytes. `stackplan` treats any slot that the function both stores and
  loads as local workspace, so its fallback argument inference no longer hides
  that VECTOR merely because the following aggregate supplies the first
  formed stack address.
- **Two xyz triplets exactly 0x10 bytes apart can be one `VECTOR[2]`
  workspace, not an output plus three scalar spills.** The strong target
  signature is an address formed for the first element, reads of its first
  three words, then `sw`/`lw` pairs at `base+0x10/+0x14/+0x18`. In
  FUN_80035f44, three independent `long` captures stayed in registers and
  produced only 200 instructions; storing them in `rotated[1].vx/vy/vz`
  recovered the target's sp+0x58/0x5c/0x60 workspace and 207 of 208
  instructions. A named readback after the neighbouring field store supplied
  the final schedule and matched all 832 bytes. `tools/stackplan.py` reports
  this signature as a `vector-array hint`; treat it as layout evidence and
  still verify that the values really have VECTOR semantics.
- **For mutually-exclusive aggregate layouts, make the overlap an explicit
  union instead of hoping scopes share slots.** Run `tools/stackplan.py <Name>`:
  it reads the candidate's outgoing-argument size, the target's first
  callee-saved spill, and every target/candidate `sp+offset` access. The reported
  working window is the exact scratch-union extent. Give the union one struct
  view per mode/path and use padding to place members at the target offsets.
  ProcItemFire's ordinary block locals made a 0xb0-byte frame; its target says
  args end at sp+0x18 and saves begin at sp+0x78, so a 0x60-byte union with
  particle, drop, explosion and frame views reproduced the exact 0x98-byte
  frame and every stack offset. This is an explicit layout technique, not a
  claim that every target used a union—verify the complete byte diff.
  The same rule now covers a broad hard-function sample: ProcItemJirai's
  cleanup/request scratch, DrawBlood's `scr@0x18`/position/temp overlay,
  FUN_8003562c's 0x28 render scratch, ProcItemShinsoku's position/launch
  overlap, ProcItemHenshin's packed saved-record view, and ProcItemKaengeki's
  request/camera-output window. When several independently recovered functions
  converge on the same target workspace boundary, prefer the explicit union
  over padding unrelated locals until the frame happens to fit.
  For a large frame with no trustworthy decompiler locals, add
  `--emit-overlay`: stackplan also recognizes `addiu reg,sp,offset` as an
  address-taken aggregate boundary, infers outgoing o32 argument space when the
  split target lost its `.frame args=` comment, and emits a padded C struct with
  scalar widths at every target access. LoadConstruction's scaffold recovered
  the full sp+0x20..0x177 window and led directly to its exact 0x1a0 frame.
  The generated names are deliberately neutral; replace byte regions with
  PSX.SYM/Ghidra-proven aggregates before treating it as semantic source. Use
  `--args N` when the inferred outgoing boundary is ambiguous. Once the plain
  report recovers a working window it prints the exact cached
  `-n --emit-overlay` follow-up, so do not stop at the union hint: emit the
  scaffold before hand-counting padding. ActDEAD independently recovered a
  0x28 union this way, placing its `VECTOR` at sp+0x10 and two `SVECTOR`s at
  sp+0x28/sp+0x30 while retaining semantic aggregate types.
- **A stack aggregate pointer can coexist with DIRECT member spellings, and
  that mix may be the target.** Keep `p = &local` alive for the one field whose
  store is base-relative and for the later call, but spell other fields as
  `local.field`. ProcItemFire needed `launch->user` and `ReqItemDrop(launch)` to
  retain `$s0`, while direct `launch.start/end` spellings emitted the target's
  `sp+offset` loads/stores and preserved its loaded-z call delay slot. Making
  every access `p->field` added a reload and a call-delay `nop`; making every
  access direct deleted the pointer.
  DrawTarget supplies the compact output-overlay form: one `SVECTOR scr` is
  passed to RotTransPers through `SVECTOR *p = &scr`, its returned OTZ is
  written as `p->vz`, and the following call reads `scr.vx/vy/vz` directly.
  The pointer therefore survives RotTransPers in `$s0` for the base-relative
  halfword write, then dies so the direct members reload from `$sp`; the
  colour argument takes `$s1` and the target 0x28 frame follows naturally.
  Writing `scr.vz = RotTransPers(..., (s32 *)&scr, ...)` without the pointer
  keeps the result in a register and shrinks the frame to 0x20. Three separate
  shorts are not an equivalent alias model: a packed SXY write through the
  first scalar does not make its neighbours members of one address-taken
  object. When target stack evidence shows `addr sp+K`, a base-relative
  write after the call, then direct loads at `sp+K/+2/+4`, try one aggregate
  plus this mixed pointer/direct view.
- **A local ARRAY element pointer can likewise coexist with selected typed
  byte-offset lvalues.** Keep `sprite = &bank[i]` for calls and the fields whose
  target accesses stay base-relative, but spell a target-rematerialized store
  as `((T *)((u8 *)bank + i * sizeof(T)))->field`. The strong signature is
  repeated target `addiu reg,sp,K` sites while the candidate forms `&bank[i]`
  once and retains it in a saved register. mission_score_screen needed this for
  the final `mx`/`my` stores of both sprite banks; using the pointer everywhere
  suppressed those stack-address formations. `rtlguide` reports the
  stack-address multiplicity gap and prioritizes guided aggressive rule
  `array-alias-remat`. The rule accepts only matching-type, unshadowed
  function-scope array/pointer locals and a stable local/parameter index in one
  straight-line block; it also emits an atomic adjacent-store pair.
- **A decrement stored to `u8` but tested later can want a full-width host plus
  explicit narrow tests.** `s32 count = byte - 1; byte = count;` followed by
  `if ((u8)count == ...)` keeps one SI pseudo for the add/store/control-flow and
  emits narrowing only where each path needs it. An `u8 count` may split the
  decrement and promoted value, leaving a copy and one missing instruction.
  ProcItemFire's switch matched only with the full-width host; ProcItemSmoke is
  the same family.
- **A named snapshot of a full-word global must stay full-width even if its
  comparisons fit in 16 bits.** Declaring `s32 clock = GameClock;` preserves
  the target `lw` and one SI pseudo; a `u16`/`s16` snapshot lets combine narrow
  the read to `lhu`/`lh` and can merge it into a nearby case literal
  (ProcItemArrow). This is already mechanical through `type-width`: do not
  infer a local's width solely from the constants compared against it.
- **An eliminated identical-arm capture can keep a stack word full-width until
  a later high-half extraction.** In FUN_800519bc, the direct
  `page = stack.word >> 16` collapsed to `lh` and made the exact-length draft
  one instruction short. Capturing `stack.word` in an `s32`, then assigning the
  same shifted value in both arms of a condition on an already initialized
  strip width, survived long enough to retain `lw; nop; sra`; jump2 removed the
  condition itself. A small nested fence on the width-dependent position
  expression then restored the two saved-register homes. This is narrower than
  making the stack access volatile, which changed block layout and length.
- **Capture a narrow call result separately when its destination store must be
  delayed across independent arithmetic.** Assigning GetTPage directly to the
  sprite field stored it immediately. Keeping the `u16` result in a local,
  loading the independent x base, and fencing only the eventual field store let
  sched2 fill the load delay with the position shift and place the tpage store
  at the retail boundary, without changing the call or value semantics.
- The **cast type's alignment drives copy code**: `*(VECTOR *)a =
  *(VECTOR *)b` is a word block move (4×`lw`+4×`sw`, `$t2/$t3/$t4/$t1`
  rotation; a 0x50-byte struct assignment becomes the 16-bytes-per-iteration
  copy loop), while `*(SVECTOR *)a = *(SVECTOR *)b` (align 2) is `lwl/lwr` +
  `swl/swr` pairs.
  - **An opaque `struct { u8 bytes[N]; }` deliberately carries alignment 1.**
    Assigning that struct between two byte-buffer views makes `emit_block_move`
    generate its runtime-alignment path and aligned/unaligned loop family.
    This exactly recovered LoadCard's 0xe70-byte persistent-state copy,
    SaveCard's 0x20-byte palette copy, and its three 0x80-byte icon copies.
    Do not hand-transcribe the resulting `lwl/lwr/swl/swr` loops.
    Exception for allocator control: SaveSI had the correct block-move shapes
    but needed the 0x80-byte icon copies written explicitly as 0x10-byte
    aligned/unaligned chunk loops. That keeps semantics and the runtime
    alignment dispatch while exposing `src`, `dst`, alignment, end, and chunk
    roles as reusable C locals. Use this only after the aggregate form proves
    structurally exact and RTL shows the residual is cursor allocation.
  - **This holds for a member of a parameter union too, even when Ghidra renders
    it as `long`-by-`long` temp copies.** `ef->param.bleed.pos = *pos;` (VECTOR,
    align 4) and `.vec = *vec;` (SVECTOR, align 2) reproduce the target's batched
    load-then-batched-store block move exactly; the field-at-a-time transcription
    does not (SetBleed).
  - **Four adjacent `vx/vy/vz/pad` assignments may be one aggregate VECTOR
    assignment.** `dst = *src` goes through cc1's block-move expansion and can
    batch/interleave the four loads and stores differently from
    `dst.vx=src->vx; ...`. DamageControl's target requires the aggregate form.
    The local, exact-field-set transform is now the default `autorules` rule
    `vector-copy`; the `pad` requirement prevents it from inventing a partial
    copy or silently changing padding semantics.
  - **Three field copies plus one adjusted component can require COPY FIRST,
    ADJUST SECOND.** If the target stores an unmodified component to a stack
    slot, later modifies that register, then overwrites the same slot, write
    `dst.vx = src.vx; dst.vy = src.vy; dst.vz = src.vz; dst.vy -= C;`.
    Folding the middle pair into `dst.vy = src.vy - C;` deletes the first store
    and leaves a load-delay `nop`; the explicit copy gives sched2 independent
    address/global work with which to fill that slot. ProcItemNinken gained one
    semantic store but no machine instruction—the store replaced the `nop`—and
    matched its full vector setup. `rtlguide` names the
    `copy-then-inplace-adjust` signature and `autorules`' symmetric
    `vector-copy-adjust` rule enumerates both spellings for nonvolatile locals.
  - **A whole-pool swap-remove is a plain struct assignment `pool[i] =
    pool[last];`** — Ghidra mis-renders it as a hand `do{}while` over invented
    per-field names with a halfword-typed (`sh`) tail; both wrong. A 0x78-byte
    word-aligned struct assignment compiles to `emit_block_move`'s
    `MAX_MOVE_BYTES`=0x10 (4-word) loop over the aligned bulk (0x70) + the
    leftover 8 bytes as two `lw`/`sw`. `tools/access.py <Name> --order` showing
    every copy insn (tail included) as `sw` disproves the field-typed rendering —
    trust it over Ghidra's struct-field names (DeleteConflict).
  - **A small table copied to a stack local is ONE struct assignment, not N
    element assignments** (`load_layout`). N array-element assignments from a
    nonzero-offset extern (`local[0]=Ext[0]; local[1]=Ext[1]; …`) make cc1 fold
    the offset-0 read directly off the `%hi` register while materializing a full
    base address only for the nonzero-offset ones — *two different addressing
    shapes in one sequence*. A genuine small (≤16-byte) whole-struct assignment
    (`local_18 = D_80012168;`, both sides typed as one struct with an inline
    array field) instead forces `emit_block_move` to materialize ONE base
    register up front and emit the batched-loads-then-batched-stores idiom.
    Write it that way whenever Ghidra renders a source table copied to a stack
    local (later indexed by a runtime variable) as separate per-element stores.
  - **A whole-struct copy from a nonzero enclosing member may also need a NAMED
    source pointer.** `local = Enclosing.member;` can still fold the member
    displacement into each `lwl/lwr` source access, leaving only the enclosing
    symbol's `%hi` base.  The two-statement spelling `T *src =
    &Enclosing.member; local = *src;` forces one full member address first, then
    zero-based block-copy accesses.  Use this when the target has
    `lui base; addiu src,base,%lo(member); lwl/lwr ...,0/3/4/7(src)` rather than
    loads carrying the member offset themselves.  InitEffect verified the two
    forms A/B: only the named `blood_src` form produces its target copy of the
    eight-byte table at `D_80097A38 + 8`.
- **A truncated per-TU struct breaks when the element is array-INDEXED, not
  just pointer-dereferenced.** The "declare only the fields you touch" truncation
  (DisposeBG-style) is safe for `ptr->field`, but `arr[i]` compiles the index as
  `i * sizeof(T)` — a truncated `T` computes the wrong stride. FUN_80027304
  indexing the conflict pool with `ConflictObjectType` truncated to 0x14 bytes
  emitted `sll;addu;sll` (stride 0x14) instead of the target's `sll v0,a0,4;
  subu v0,v0,a0; sll v0,v0,3` (stride 0x78); replicating GetConflictResult.c's
  full 0x78 layout fixed it. When indexing an already-typed pool array from a new
  file, reuse the proven full-size element struct, never a truncated prefix.
- Write grouped stores **through the same base expression** a later copy
  reads (`((s32 *)(buf + 0x10))[n] = ...;` rather than
  `*(s32 *)(buf + 0x18) = ...;`): with distinct address pseudos the scheduler
  loses the store→copy dependence and interleaves the copy into the divide
  latency (differently from the original).
- **An unexplained frame-size gap — the target's frame is bigger with no
  load/store touching the extra bytes — is often a DEAD/UNUSED local.** cc1
  reserves stack for every declared automatic aggregate regardless of use; when
  the gap exactly equals a sibling function's struct size, declare that struct
  as an unused local (AttackGunControl: an unused `PARAM_ITEM_USE p;` = 40 bytes, a
  refactoring leftover from wrapping bow_shoot_logic). An earlier-build debug
  record can make an otherwise suspicious array equally concrete:
  FUN_8004a6bc's target saves begin 0x20 bytes later than its live values need,
  while PSX.SYM records `unsigned char image[25]` at sp+16 in the demo's
  combined InitializeInfoView. Declaring that same unused array in the retail
  helper reserves 25 bytes plus alignment and recovers the exact frame. Prefer
  this cross-build name/type/offset evidence over anonymous padding.
- **Overlapping big frame buffers whose addresses rematerialize at every
  call are INLINED STATIC HELPERS, not locals** (DoInfoViewProc's debug
  menus). Mechanics, all three observable in the bytes:
  (1) a frame-address argument (`&local` / decayed array, any spelling) is
  forced into a pseudo by calls.c `precompute_register_parameters` whenever
  its offset from the frame base is nonzero (the value is `(plus vreg c)`,
  not a REG) — and two same-valued forced pseudos in one extended basic
  block get cse'd into a single callee-saved register (`addiu $s0,$sp,N` +
  `move $a1,$s0` twice), costing an extra prologue save. A helper's OWN
  first local sits at inlined-frame offset 0, so its address is the bare
  remapped register → every call re-materializes `addiu $a1,$sp,N` like the
  original. (2) inline expansion allocates the helper frame as a TEMP SLOT,
  freed at the call statement's end: the next inlined helper's frame REUSES
  it if it fits (cc1 never overlaps ordinary sibling-scope locals — verified
  again by probe). DoInfoViewProc: item menu 0xC8 @ sp+0x78; the next
  helper's 0x40 layout+confirm pair reuses 0x78/0xA0; the 0xF8 effect menu
  doesn't fit the freed slot and lands fresh at 0x140; caller's own `mm`
  local sits below at 0x20. Frame = args 0x20 + 0x58 + 0xC8 + 0xF8 + saves
  = 0x248, byte-exact. The tell to look for: same sp offset written by two
  unrelated struct copies + `addiu $a1,$sp,N` repeated per call + a frame
  smaller than the sum of the visible buffers. **The inverse tell**: when
  args + sum(buffers) + saves/pad equals the frame exactly
  (LayoutEnemyOption: 0x10+0x58+0x18+0x38+8 = 0xC0), the buffers are PLAIN
  LOCALS — each struct-copy loop's CODE_LABEL breaks the cse window between
  the copy's address use and the call's, so the merge never fires and
  addresses rematerialize without helpers. A menu copied at ENTRY but only
  read in a later case body is real source order, not a helper.
  Verified mechanics (RTL dumps, BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen): each
  frame-address arg expands to its own `reg := (plus fp c)` pseudo; the cse
  pass merges same-valued ones ACROSS CALLS (calls invalidate only hard regs
  and memory, not pseudo equivalences) — only a CODE_LABEL breaks the window.
  Passing the written object as the helper's pointer PARAMETER keeps later
  argument uses direct too: integrate substitutes the argument address and
  folds it per-use, so `Helper(buf, &hspr)` + a later `GsSortSprite(&hspr,…)`
  both emit fresh `addiu $aN,$sp,c` (probe-verified against the original's
  delay-slot placement). A pointer variable (`p = &spr;`) is the ORIGINAL's
  shape when the object is the FIRST local (its address is the bare frame
  reg, so the copy is free) and field accesses mix `p->` with direct `var.`
  spellings — keep both spellings exactly as Ghidra shows them.
- **A division variable carried around an in-loop call goes through a
  quotient temp reassigned at the loop BOTTOM**: `q = d / 10; …; call;
  …; av = q; } while ((s16)av != 0);` — the bottom test cse's to q's
  register and av's live range stays off the call (caller-saved, like the
  original). Writing `av = d / 10;` at the top extends av's range across the
  call → callee-saved reg + a whole allocation cascade
  (BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen's item-count digits).
- **Repeated unrolled digit bodies can require independent source identities
  even though every copy operates on the same stack sprite.** When the target
  rematerializes `&sprite` in each copy but the draft retains it in one saved
  register, give each source copy a block-local pointer, current value, and
  quotient. A C macro is a convenient way to repeat that scope without emitting
  a helper call. Do not mechanically localize everything: values which the
  target carries through all copies must stay function-scoped. In
  StageEndScreen, a function-wide pointer/value/quotient draft had 3732 byte
  differences and 50.23% fuzzy similarity. Per-copy pointer, `u32 value`, `s32
  quotient`, and `s16 signed_value` identities reached the exact 6084-byte/1521-
  instruction size with 1690 differences and 79.68%; localizing the shared base
  or negative flag rotated saved registers and regressed. `rtlguide.py` now
  reports `repeat-block-local-pointer` when a large rematerialization gap and a
  candidate saved-register cache make this source shape likely.

  A related bottom-test lever is a destructive narrow working copy after the
  next value has already been saved:
  `value = quotient; quotient <<= 16; } while (quotient != 0);`. If `quotient`
  is dead after the test, this produces
  the target's `move; sll; bnez` chain. Testing `(s16)value` instead can create a
  fresh temporary and the wrong loop-tail allocation. Confirm the target chain
  and the quotient's deadness before using this spelling.
- **The final copy of a repeated digit loop may need a scoped byte base while
  the preceding copies keep a shared word base — but its optional sign can need
  a fresh promoted capture.** A function-shared `u32 base` keeps the repeated
  post-call `andi base,0xff` and gives the saved byte one allocator identity
  across the run. If every complete copy is exact but the LAST digit pass is one
  instruction long, clone only that final source block and shadow `base` with a
  block-local `u8 base`: capture it in the main digit pass, carry it across the
  sprite call, and restore it there. Do not assume that narrow identity should
  also cross the optional-minus call. Re-reading `sprite->u` into a block-local
  `u32 sign_base` for only the sign suffix gives that shorter region an
  independent promoted live range. StageEndScreen's first fifteen loops required
  the shared `u32`; narrowing all sixteen destroyed the target shape, narrowing
  only the final main pass removed its isolated excess, and promoting only the
  final sign capture erased the remaining 21-byte allocation cluster. Apply
  these width choices only after per-region instruction and CFG counts prove
  that the unmatched tail is not being cancelled by the following block.

- **u16 init `= -1` with `addiu -1` AND `lhu` reloads = a 2-byte union**:
  `union { u16 u; s16 s; } pad; pad.s = -1;` — the unpromoted HImode pseudo
  stores the sign-extended canonical constant while `.u` reads stay `lhu`.
  Plain `u16 pad = -1;` gives `ori 0xffff` (see the initializer note above).
- **Inside an ADDRESS expression, a mult-by-constant subterm expands FIRST**
  (`arr[a + b*c]` → `addu chr32,idx` regardless of source order): EXPAND_SUM
  special-cases the mult. Spelling the scale as a SHIFT
  (`arr[idx + (ps->chr << 5)]`) skips the special case and preserves source
  order; a sum assigned to a value temp first (`int n = j + chr * 0x20;`)
  also expands in source order.
- **Pointer-local spelling extends the addu-order rule**: `tp->n[x]` through
  a struct-pointer emits `addu base,index`; `tp[x]` on a plain `char **`
  emits `addu index,base` (AddMisc).
- **A chain of N identical `table + offset` lookups software-pipelines when each
  table address goes through its OWN named local pointer** (`T *p2 = table2; …
  p2[off];`) rather than an inline extern-array cast at the use site. The named
  pointer lets cc1 schedule table K+1's address materialization to overlap table
  K's load/store latency (2-deep pipeline); the inline-cast form computes the
  shift/mask first and serializes. The LAST table in the chain needs no temp —
  nothing follows to overlap with (SetupThinkFunction).
- **A signed `slt` on a pointer comparison is an `(s32)` cast pair in
  source** (Ghidra renders it as `(int)ptr < -0x7ff…`).
- **A TU sibling can mislead: two functions in the same TU touching the same
  region need not share an addressing shape.** `FUN_80039544` reaches the
  scratchpad through flat per-statement `*(T *)0x1F8000xx` casts (a repeated
  `lui $at` per store) while its twins `FUN_800396c0`/`FUN_80039684` cache a
  `MATRIX *`/`SVECTOR *` local. Check the raw `.s` for the repeated `lui $at`
  before importing a twin's cached-pointer idiom.
- **One C variable is ONE pseudo for the whole function, not one per
  occurrence.** So a value playing the same role in two mutually-exclusive
  switch-case bodies must reuse the SAME C variable across the cases when the
  target reuses the same hard register in both. Pick the variable to reuse by
  matching the ROLE across cases: reusing a *different* already-used variable
  (one tied to another role) drags that case's own allocation off-target too
  (EquipWeapon's `a` = "the `wp[0]` value" in both the 4-swap and 2-swap cases).
- **Array spelling picks the addu operand order**: `p->arr[i]` emits
  `addu base,index`; `(&p->arr[0])[i]` emits `addu index,base`;
  `((T *)0x80010000)->arr[i]` emits index-first with a split `lui`+lo
  displacement that cse merges into any register already holding the
  constant; an extern-array symbol emits `la` (lui+addiu), not the split.
  - **The `(&p->arr[0])[i]` respelling only works on a struct-member array
    reached THROUGH A POINTER.** It has zero effect on a top-level
    `extern T arr[N]` indexed directly — verified by trying it on `leSetEnemy`'s
    identical-looking tie after it had fixed `leAddPath`. Don't reach for it when
    the base is a plain extern array; the tie there is local-allocation ordering.
  - **Two ADJACENT data tables are separate symbols, not one array indexed with
    a constant offset.** When a load's `lh/lw` displacement is 0 and the base
    address equals a *different* nearby symbol's address, declare that second
    symbol (`atkd2` at atkd+8) rather than writing `atkd[wclass+4]` — the array
    form folds the +4 into the index and materializes `atkd`'s base, not
    `atkd2`'s (Think3firstattack).
  - **Don't factor out a cursor pointer when the target wants index-first.**
    Repeating the raw index (`map[j].a; map[j].b; …`) vs caching it
    (`rec = &map[j];`) FLIPS the addu order: the pointer-temp assignment trips
    cc1's source-order exception to EXPAND_SUM's mult-first special case. If the
    target's addu is index-first on a plainly-indexed pointer, keep the repeated
    `map[j]` and trust cse to still cache the address — the `rec` temp is wrong
    (LoadAreaMap).
  A hoisted-hi clamp loop with base-first addu is a block-local pointer
  variable (`PersistentState *cq = (PersistentState *)0x80010000;`), one per
  duplicated loop copy (separate pseudos → different hi registers).
- **Division shortening is blocked by an int dividend temp**: `d = av;
  quo = d / 10;` (both int, av s16) keeps the division SImode — quo stores
  raw, no widening pair. `av / 10` directly (or an s16 quo) gets shortened
  to HImode by the front end and widens at the int store. Write the
  remainder through a temp (`rem = d - quo * 10; … (s16)rem * w`) — folding
  the cast over the subtraction distributes it into `(s16)quo * 10` instead.
  The loop-carried copy needs quo int too: `av = quo; } while ((s16)av != 0)`
  folds the ext to the sll-only `bnez` pinned after the copy; with both s16
  the test hoists across the call and av/quo coalesce (the move vanishes).
- **`t = scale ± 0x10; scale = t; if ((s16)t < K)` — compare the temp**:
  reading `scale` in the compare lets combine collapse the pair back into
  one `addiu scale,scale,±16` (the target keeps the temp shape).

## Reading cc1's RTL dumps (the escalation method)

**When a draft is the CORRECT LENGTH but a handful of bytes differ, and both C
respelling and a bounded permuter run have failed, STOP guessing and read the RTL.**
Every such "permuter-immune, below-the-C-level" residual this project has escalated —
nine in a row — turned out to be *reachable source structure* that the dumps name
outright: a guard's operand order, a statement's position, a block boundary, a `fold`
reassociation, a loop.c hoist threshold. The permuter can't find these (it transforms
the C AST; the divergence is chosen in a later RTL pass), and blind respelling is a
lottery. The dump tells you which pass diverged and why, so you solve for the fix.

This is not a Fable-only skill — it is a mechanical procedure. Any agent can do it.

**Re-verify a park header's "permuter-immune" / "below-the-C-level" verdict before
trusting it — the header can be WRONG.** `FUN_8004a368` was parked as "the same
PrepareAccess/cd_open la-reload tie" and closed in minutes once someone checked it
against a DOCUMENTED rule instead: it was the offset-0-alias-vs-struct-member `%hi`
lever (grep the target address's OTHER name in sibling TU files — 0x80089f00 is both
`CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR` and `CamState.Owner`, and the two spellings
choose different `%hi` register homes). Before spending an RTL dive or accepting a park,
match the residual against the cookbook's named classes first.

### The tool

`tools/rtldump.py <Name>` compiles `src/main.exe/<Name>.c` exactly as `./Build` does
(same cpp defines, same cc1-281 flags) but STANDALONE in the scratchpad — no Shake, no
`.shake/` database, so it never races a concurrent build and each run is ~1 s. It writes
the requested RTL dump passes next to the `.s`:

For a guarded `#ifndef NON_MATCHING` source, "exactly as `./Build` does" means
the default command compiles the `INCLUDE_ASM` stub. Pass `--draft` whenever the
RTL question concerns the guarded C body; otherwise the dump is valid but for
the wrong implementation.

```
tools/rtldump.py <Name>                 # greg, lreg, jump, combine (the usual four)
tools/rtldump.py <Name> --pass loop     # loop.c invariant hoisting
tools/rtldump.py <Name> --pass all      # every pass (-da): cse, flow, sched, dbr, …
tools/rtldump.py <Name> --draft         # the #else NON_MATCHING draft
tools/rtldump.py <Name> --lines         # + source-line-mapped object/disassembly
```

The mechanical front end is `tools/rtlguide.py <Name>`. It performs the
assembly alignment and pass selection, invokes the full standalone dump with
debug line notes, and reports:

- each residual hunk's likely owner (`greg/lreg`, `cse`, `combine`, `jump2`, or
  `sched2/dbr`);
- the concrete C line(s) that emitted our side of the hunk;
- candidate→target hard-register substitutions, including C locals and `.greg`
  preferences occupying the candidate register;
- instruction/label/move counts across the passes; and
- a bounded `tools/autorules.py <Name> --guided` search command.

`tools/rtlguide.py <Name> --json` exposes the same report to other tools.
`--no-build` is only safe when the current `.shake` image is already the
NON_MATCHING draft, not the default INCLUDE_ASM stub. `matchdiff` now checks
the linked map for `<Name>.NON_MATCHING` and refuses that stale/trivial artifact
even with `-n`; this caught a concurrent default build that briefly made an
unmatched guarded draft appear byte-exact.

There is necessarily no "target RTL" to diff: the retail executable contains
only machine code. Target assembly is therefore the specification; our RTL is
an explanation of how cc1 reached the wrong machine code. We mutate readable C,
never RTL itself.

Pair it with a scoring loop to make each hypothesis a ~5-second test: edit the `.c`,
`NON_MATCHING=<Name> ./Build` (or a standalone `cc1-281 | maspsx | as | objdump`),
`tools/asmdiff.py <Name> -n`. Read the dump ONCE to form the hypothesis; iterate with
the fast loop, not by re-dumping.

### What each pass tells you

| dump | pass | read it for |
|---|---|---|
| `.greg` | global-alloc (`-dg`) | `N in H` = pseudo N landed in hard reg H; `N preferences: H`; `N conflicts: …`. THE register-tie dump. |
| `.lreg` | local-alloc (`-dl`) | per-block allocation before global; where a copy chain starts. |
| `.loop` | loop opt (`-dL`) | biv/giv analysis with `benefit`/`used`/`lifetime` — the invariant-hoist threshold economy (see its own cookbook section). |
| `.combine` | combine (`-dc`) | where an `addu`/`subu` operand order or a `fold` reassociation is fixed. |
| `.cse`/`.cse2` | CSE (`-ds`) | which repeat load/address got folded to a copy; `record_jump_equiv` guard folds. cse1 stops at `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END`, cse2 does not. |
| `.jump2` | jump opt (`-dj`) | cross-jump merges, `make_return_insns`, which `return K` island survives. |
| `.sched`/`.sched2` | scheduling (`-dS`) | load-delay/latency fills; why a `nop` or an independent insn lands in a slot. |
| `.dbr` | reorg (`-dd`/`-dR`) | delay-slot branch fills; `mostly_true_jump` prediction (needs `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP` from a real `for`). |

Hard reg numbers: `0` zero, `1` at, `2` v0, `3` v1, `4`–`7` a0–a3, `8`–`15` t0–t7,
`16`–`23` s0–s7, `24`–`25` t8–t9, `28` gp, `29` sp, `30` fp/s8, `31` ra.

### The procedure

1. **Locate the diverging instruction** with `tools/matchdiff.py`/`asmdiff.py`, and which
   register or offset differs (e.g. our `$v1` vs target `$v0`, or a store at gp+28 vs
   gp+32, or a missing/extra instruction).
2. **Dump the pass that owns that decision.** A wrong register home → `.greg`
   (`N in H`, `N conflicts`, `N preferences`). An extra/missing loop instruction →
   `.loop`. An operand-order or fold difference → `.combine`. A delay-slot `nop` →
   `.sched2`/`.dbr`. A `return`/branch-target difference → `.jump2`/`.cse`.
3. **Read what the pass DECIDED and work backward to the source construct** that forced
   it. The load-bearing invariants of THIS cc1 (2.8.1), all confirmed against its
   sources this session:
   - **A pseudo's live range is NEVER split.** One C variable is exactly one hard reg
     for its whole life. So two roles sharing one hard reg = ONE variable doing double
     duty; one value appearing in two hard regs across disjoint regions = TWO variables.
   - **`global.c`'s `find_reg`** makes an earlier (higher-priority) allocno AVOID a reg a
     later allocno prefers — donate a call-arg preference to steer the high-priority one.
   - Allocno **priority sums refs and live-length across the whole range** and moves in
     `floor_log2` jumps, so merging two disjoint same-role temps into one variable can
     vault it over a rival (vfree).
   - **`loop.c` hoisting is a threshold economy** — its own section.
   - **`fold`/`combine`** fixes operand order and reassociation: `a - (C - b)` survives
     as `(a-C)+b`, `a - C + b` reassociates; a comparison evaluates op0 first.
   - **`cse` + `jump2`** decide `return`-island merges and guard-test folds; block
     boundaries (a nested `if` vs a wrapper, a label between two blocks) are the lever.
   - **The priorities printed in a scheduler dump are not necessarily the ready-list
     priorities used for the final choice.** gcc 2.8.1's `adjust_priority` promotes a
     single-set producer that births a pseudo before `rank_for_schedule`; equal
     post-adjustment candidates are then sensitive to their reverse-scheduling LUID
     order. In SuccessionAttack, splitting the signed Degree load into a single-set
     `raw` pseudo fixed both scheduler passes even though the initial printed
     priorities suggested a plain tie. For a cluster of genuinely equal-priority
     independent loads, reverse their source assignments as one bounded probe:
     ProcItemNingyo's `owner,type,model` declarations scheduled
     `model,owner,type`, while spelling `model,type,owner` produced
     `owner,type,model` and reduced its exact-length residual from six bytes to
     four. This cannot rotate a separately lower-priority producer, so confirm
     the post-adjustment priorities before enumerating more orders. The final
     four bytes closed by loading through a single-set `loaded_model` alias and
     immediately copying it into the destructively reused `model`: the load
     gained the missing scheduler promotion, while copy coalescing erased the
     assignment and kept both roles in `$s0`. This split-then-coalesce pattern
     is the bounded lever when the target wants a multi-set destination's load
     to tie otherwise-promoted single-set producers.
   - **`.sched2` being exact does not make a delay-slot `nop` safe.** Reorg's later
     `fill_simple_delay_slots` can still pull any independent eligible instruction
     into the branch slot. If `.dbr` alone changes the sequence, stop permuting nearby
     statements: a real dependency, block boundary, or other source-visible
     eligibility change is required. SuccessionAttack's remaining six-byte
     checkpoint is the measured case.
   - **`sched`/`reorg`** are alias-conservative: an address-taken local's load never
     schedules above ANY pointer store — reorder STATEMENTS, don't chase the scheduler.
4. **Form ONE hypothesis, test it with the fast scoring loop, repeat.** The worked
   examples: vrealloc, vfree, valloc, Sound, turn_towards_player_, UpdateMotion,
   HangCheck, GetConflictResult, SetSmoke — read their file headers for the exact
   dump-to-source reasoning on each.

## Register allocation steering

### A default-then-override temp keeps the object's address alive

If your draft is **N instructions SHORT** and the missing instructions are an
address recomputation (`lui`/`addiu` + the `sll`/`addu` index scaling) for an
lvalue you already stored to earlier, look for a temp feeding that store:

```c
cnt = 100;                     /* or: if (h->life == 0) cnt = 100; else cnt = 300; */
if (cond) cnt = 300;
LifeBar[g].count = cnt;        /* one store, address pseudo now live... */
if (LifeBar[g].max < 1) { … }  /* ...so cc1 REUSES it here. Target recomputes. */
```

The shared temp keeps `&LifeBar[g]` live in a register across the following
access. Write the two arms as **independent stores** instead:

```c
if (h->life == 0) LifeBar[g].count = 100;
else              LifeBar[g].count = 300;
```

cc1 cross-jump-merges those into the *identical single store*, but the later
`LifeBar[g]` access is now a genuinely fresh pseudo and gets recomputed from
scratch — base and index registers swapped, exactly as the target does
(ReqLifeBar; 9 instructions / 36 bytes recovered). Verified empirically; the
`cse.c` mechanism that declines to merge the second occurrence is not root-caused,
so treat this as a shape to try, not a law.

### gcc 2.8.1 never splits a pseudo's live range: one C variable = one hard register

For its whole life. So when the target shows one *logical* value in two different
registers across disjoint regions, the source had **two variables**. And when two
different-looking roles share one register across disjoint regions, it was **ONE
variable doing double duty** — and its call-argument copy-preference travels with it
into the other region. (`vrealloc`: the grow-branch mask and the memcpy length are
the same variable.)

Treat a shared physical suffix as stronger evidence than decompiler scopes. In
`ControlHumanoid`, the player camera's small-angle store and the enemy vertical
clamp's store both use the target's `$v1`, then jump into one shared
`UpdateCoordinate` tail. Keeping both signed roles in one function-scope `direction`
local let jump2 cross-jump the identical `sh` suffix; two tidier block locals left two
copies and made the exact-length function eight bytes too long. When mutually
exclusive branches converge through the same hard register and identical store/call
tail, first try one reused variable plus literal duplicated tails and let cross-jump
perform the factoring. `rtlguide` classifies the resulting register-only residual;
do not manually factor the source before testing this identity clue.

The same rule spans sequential phases with no shared tail. In `AddEnemy`, reusing
the first scan's `short i` for the think-menu scan, the dead name-buffer offset for
the selected enemy type, and the dead count for the final x coordinate restored
retail's `$s4`, `$s7`, and `$s5` assignments. Fresh semantic names were cleaner but
created fresh pseudos and rotated the whole saved-register family. Require both
disjoint `.lreg` lifetimes and the target's repeated hard-register homes; source
names alone do not justify merging values.

### A target-register hard conflict means weighting is the wrong lever

Before adding one-shot-loop depth to a register-only residual, inspect the
allocno's `.greg` conflict set. If the desired hard register is listed, no
priority change can put that pseudo there: change its lifetime, identity, or
coalescing. `rtlguide` now prints `HARD-CONFLICT` for candidate allocnos in this
state instead of merely suggesting allocation priorities.

There is a mechanical special case when several branch arms load distinct
literals into one carrier and one final store consumes it. If target and
candidate retain the same instruction count, opcodes, immediates, store, and
physical control-flow inventory, but consistently use different carrier
registers, `rtlguide` reports **`branch-phi-register-tie`**. It prioritizes
`shared-tail-assign`, `flag-arm-assign`, and `guard-flag-assign`, followed by
`type-width`; these are the only useful first trials because they can split the
source identity or move its definitions without inventing a backend clobber.
Reject a tempting register win if it adds a physical jump or changes the
function extent. Allocation priority can never overcome a hard-register
conflict; the interference graph itself has to change.

Read a target delay-slot literal that overwrites the branch condition register
as source-identity evidence. Make the destination carrier absorb the preceding
condition instead of defining the result while a separate condition temporary
is still live. This can require a whole in-place chain, not just the final test:
load the first condition into the carrier, assign a comparison result back into
it, and reuse it for later comparison constants before assigning the final arm
values. If the other comparison operand must remain separate, reuse a dead named
local that already has the target secondary-register colour.

`think_setting_small_rotation_small_steps_` is the exact example. Direct-arm
spellings gained `$v0` but duplicated the store/jump tail; QI-to-SI and priority
fences were flat because pseudo 107 still hard-conflicted with `$v0`. The match
made signed-word `nextState` successively carry `actcnt`, `Humans`, the `< 30`
boolean, the constant `8`, and the final `1`/`2`. Reusing the now-dead
`alertTime` local for `StageID` kept that operand in `$v1`, removed the last hard
`$v0` conflict, and reproduced all three delay-slot overwrites with one store.
An independent prototype audit also corrected both `turn_towards_player_` and
its receiving `result` to `s16`; the paired correction was byte-neutral but
restored the source types before the allocation fix.

ActCHASE supplied two exact, reusable forms:

- The target loads `MotionUpdateMode` into `$v1`, branches on it, then writes
  loop index zero back to `$v1` in the delay slot. Separate mode and `i`
  pseudos made `i` hard-conflict with `$v1`. Spelling the non-overlapping roles
  as one HImode chain—`i = MotionUpdateMode; if (i != 0) { i = 0; ... }`—made
  the delay-slot overwrite legal and simultaneously moved the compared human
  pointer to the target `$a0`.
- An artificial `next_motion` local spanning several predecessor arms
  hard-conflicted with `$v0`, which still held each pad comparison. Writing
  `motID = 0x501` / `motID = 0xb00` directly in the respective arms let
  cross-jump recover the same single physical store tail while the dead
  comparison register was reused for the literal. This is the direct-store
  complement of the shared-variable rule above: when a target branch delay
  overwrites its own condition register and all arms converge on one store,
  try duplicated direct lvalue assignments and let the compiler factor them.

`FUN_8001b2f4` supplies the pointer version. A selected-row pointer defined
before an `if` remained live with the condition pseudo, hard-conflicted with
target `$v0`, and caused a uniform `$a1/$a2/$a3/$t0` allocation cascade. Write
the same named pointer assignment as the first statement of both arms instead:

```c
if (test) {
    p = &table[row];
    acc |= *p;
} else {
    p = &table[row];
    acc &= ~*p;
}
```

Local/global allocation then sees two mutually exclusive post-branch
definitions, so the pointer can reuse the dead condition register. Delay-slot
reorg recognizes the identical address calculations, moves one into the
conditional branch's delay slot, and removes the other, leaving one physical
producer exactly where the pre-branch spelling put it. For loops, keep the
named pointer: inlining `table[row]` into both arms can create enough GIV
benefit to strength-reduce the counter and change the function length. Check
both `.greg` (the hard conflict must disappear) and `.loop` (the induction
shape must remain) before accepting this edge-duplication lever.

Also distinguish an input value from its arithmetic result when the target
does. `current = rotation->vy; result = current + turn; rotation->vy = result;`
keeps the loaded old value and the new result in separate pseudos; mutating
`current` in place forces both roles into one hard register. ActCHASE required
this in both rotation blocks before the remaining residual became a true
allocation-only problem.

### Let direct compound arms create the allocation, then let jump2 share the store

A manually factored writeback can have the exact target length and CFG yet
make the wrong pseudos compete for the old field value and the arithmetic
operand:

```c
rotation = dtR;
current = (u16)rotation->vy;
result = current - turn;
goto store_rotation;
/* ... another predecessor with current + turn ... */
store_rotation:
rotation->vy = result;
```

When the target itself contains one shared terminal `sh`, do not assume the C
source shared that store. Try the complete direct lvalues in every predecessor:

```c
dtR->vy += turn;
/* ... */
if (pad_mask == 0) {
    reset_motion();
} else {
    dtR->vy -= turn;
}
```

The direct compound expressions establish the desired load/result/operand
identities first; gcc's `jump2` can then cross-jump the identical stores back
into one physical tail. The condition polarity is part of the transformation:
placing the update in the wrong physical arm can leave a duplicated store or
the same register tie. ActNORMAL's manually shared form was exact-length with
seven residual bytes; direct `+=`/`-=` alone was one instruction long, while
pairing it with the case-2 `!=` -> `==` arm inversion matched all 948 bytes.

Guided `shared-writeback-compound` recognizes the narrow safe form: at least
two complete `alias/base`, old-field, arithmetic-result, `goto writeback`
chains; every incoming edge must fit; the base and arithmetic operand must be
side-effect-free. It emits both the direct-arm candidate and atomic variants
with each containing compound if/else inverted, so search can cross the
measured one-instruction intermediate without permuter noise.

The same rule applies inside one large state machine: split logically distinct
lifetimes even when Ghidra gave them one SSA name. A scan's current `candidate`
and its final `found` result, a pointer used before a call and the equivalent
pointer reacquired afterward, or a mode-local `eater` and a later `human` often
need separate C locals/scopes so each receives its own pseudo and copy preference.
ProcItemDokudango used all three patterns. Conversely, when the target explicitly
copies through the owning path, spelling an equivalent access as
`param->eater->target` instead of `target->target` can force that source identity
to materialise; algebraic pointer equivalence does not imply identical allocation.

### A promoted `short` parameter is TWO pseudos for free

cc1 gives a promoted `short` parameter two pseudos with no source-level copy: the
raw SImode argument-register copy, and the HImode declared variable. So a target
whose early tests read the raw arg register (`$a1`) while one later use reads a
copied register (`move $v1,$a1` in a branch delay slot) needs NO explicit copy
variable in the source — it needs the USES split per path. Two literal
`return SoundEx(...)` calls rather than one shared call let cse serve the early
uses from the SImode copy while only the divergent-path use reads the variable;
cross-jump re-merges the identical `sll/sra/jal` tails. Refines the
"one logical value in two registers = two variables" rule: the second "variable"
can be cc1's own parameter split (`Sound`).

### A negative non-power-of-two multiply is spelled as its strength reduction

`sync * -0xF0` must be written `((sync - (sync << 4)) << 4) - 0xA` (the shift/sub
sequence cc1's own strength reduction emits) to match; the literal `* -0xF0` compiles
differently. And a `(u16)x << 1` widening needs a `u32` intermediate — a `u16` one
collapses the double-shift to a single `sll` (`EndDrawing`).

### A narrowing store through a widened temp differs by a reload's signedness

`dp = sk - (u16)DrawingPage; DrawingPage = dp;` (with `sk` an `s16`, `dp` an `s32`)
matches, where the direct `DrawingPage = sk - (u16)DrawingPage;` reads as a narrowing
use and lets cc1 satisfy it with a wrongly-unsigned `lhu` reload; spelling `sk` as
`s32` instead lets cse substitute a live constant. One instruction off in opposite
directions (`EndDrawing`).

### A `(short)` cast on an int `|` call argument is a SCHEDULER lever

Not just an instruction-shape lever. `(short)(seid | human->sound)` versus the
uncast `int` expression changes where the truncating `sll/sra` sits: uncast,
extend-then-or shortens the argument's dependence chain, and sched1 then floats a
SIBLING argument's load (`$a0 = human->locate`) above it — a hard-`$a0` def while
the base pointer is still live, which evicts the base from `$a0` and costs an
instruction plus a whole-image shift. The cast (or-then-extend) restores the chain
depth so the eviction never happens. When a two-call restructuring seems to
"repartition `$a0`/`$a1` wholesale", check the argument expression's TYPE before
abandoning the structure (`Sound`; this is why an earlier two-call attempt looked
worse and was wrongly parked).

### A two-sided scalar clamp with one return island uses assignments, not direct returns

`if (x > HI) return HI; if (x < LO) return LO; return x;` can compile into
three physically separate return paths even though the target moves the input
into one return pseudo, overwrites that pseudo in either clamp arm, and reaches
one tail. Spell the latter source shape literally:
`if (x > HI) x = HI; else if (x < LO) x = LO; return x;`. On
`FUN_8002fd9c` this was the final 29-byte residual and changed directly to an
exact match. Ordinary autorules rule `clamp-shared-return` applies this rewrite
only to adjacent literal-bound tests of a nonvolatile automatic 32-bit scalar,
so narrow conversion behavior and observable destinations are left alone.

### A conditional min/max against a MEMORY operand must be the ternary

`i = (a < b) ? a : b;` reaches fold/expr.c's min path, which loads both operands into
SI registers and makes the conditional arm a register MOVE. The two-statement
`x = a; if (b < x) x = b;` re-expands the arm's memory read in the DESTINATION's narrow
mode (HImode for an `s16` local), which cannot CSE with the compare's SImode load — a
reload plus a full coloring cascade. On `UpdateMotion` this one spelling change
(`i = (mmp->motion->n < mmp->model->n) ? mmp->motion->n : mmp->model->n;`) fixed 22 of
26 residual bytes. This SUPERSEDES the older "min/clamp reload is a coloring tie, park
it" note below for the memory-operand case — it IS reachable from C, via the ternary.

### Min/clamp reload-vs-reuse is a coloring tie, not a source bug

`x = a; if (b < x) x = b;` where the target reuses the already-loaded `b` in the
assignment (`move x,b`) but our cc1 RELOADS it (a second `lbu`/`lh` in the branch)
is a register-coloring tie, not something the C controls. It happens when cc1 keeps
the POINTER to `b` alive into the assign-branch, freeing `b`'s value register for
the compare result so it must be reloaded. Permuter-immune. Do not "fix" it with an
explicit temp for `b` — a fresh local adds a move and shifts the frame; field-vs-
local and counter-reuse are all identical or worse. Park after one bounded permuter
run (`UpdateMotion`'s `min(model->n, motion->n)` — one such decision cascaded into
all 13 of its diffs).

### Reuse a DYING variable to carry a later call-crossing value (coalesce upward)

The inverse of the usual "reduce callee-saved usage" levers. Sometimes the TARGET
uses one MORE callee-saved register than your draft, because it coalesces two values
into one register across a call. When a call result dies exactly where a
call-crossing value is born, spell the second value by REUSING the dying variable,
not as a fresh local: `dist = SquareRoot0(...); ...; dist = 0x7f - (dist<<7)/18000;
dist = (dist*(10000-dy))/10000; vol = (angle<<8) | dist;` coalesces `dist` and the
volume into one `$s1` (frame 0x30), where a separate `vol` local keeps `dist`
caller-saved in a distinct register and spends an EXTRA callee-saved one (frame 0x28)
— rotating the whole register file (`SoundEx`: 61 diff lines → 5). Reach for this
when the target's frame is LARGER than yours and a call result dies near a
call-surviving definition.

### An offset-0 alias vs the enclosing struct member is a `%hi`-register lever

Under -msplit-addresses, an offset-0 alias symbol (`ALIAS->field`, ALIAS at the struct
base) folds `%hi` into the destination register (`lui $a2; lw $a2,0($a2)`), while
reaching the same pointer as a NONZERO member of its enclosing struct
(`CamState.Owner`, +0x10) splits the base into a separate register
(`lui $v1; lw $a2,0x10($v1)`). When a pointer-load reload tie (`$v1` vs the dest for
`%hi`) is the only residual, switch between the alias spelling and the struct-member
spelling (`CheckCheatCodes`, last 2 bytes).

The same rule applies to scalar aliases at nonzero offsets. `StageSequence`
initially read the scalar symbol at `0x80089f04`, which produced `lui v1; lw
v1,...(v1)`. The target's `lui v0; lw v1,...(v0)` instead came from
`CamState.mode` at `CamState + 0x14`. When that two-instruction residual
appears, run `tools/symnear.py <scalar-name-or-address>` to list earlier fixed
symbols and their exact offsets, then validate the candidate struct field.
`rtlguide` labels the shape `enclosing-global-field-load`.

`ActivateHumans` independently confirmed the pointer form on a much larger
exact-length, exact-CFG draft. Its source initially loaded the fixed alias
`CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR` at `0x80089f00`; `symnear` reported
that address as `CamState + 0x10`, and the already-proven camera layout names
that field `Owner`. Spelling the same load as `CamState.Owner` reduced the
authoritative residual from 740 to 730 bytes without changing any instruction
or CFG count. Do not delete or globally rename the alias merely because the
addresses coincide: different original translation units can legitimately
name an aggregate field and an absolute alias separately. Choose the spelling
whose `%hi`/load register identity matches the target at that use site.

Several apparent globals on one fixed page can be fields of the same aggregate.
Query them together: `tools/symnear.py CHOSEN_CHARACTER CHOSEN_LANGUAGE`
intersects their preceding-symbol windows and reports `PersistentState` with
offsets +4/+0x5e. CVAsetup matched only when all three reads used
`PSTATE->chr`/`PSTATE->language`: cc1 then kept the shared 0x80010000 base in
`$s1` across three calls. Separate scalar externs emitted another `lui`, while
caching only the character value modeled the wrong lifetime.

The shared-base evidence can include a loop result as well as adjacent fields.
In `mission_score_screen`, retail loads the inserted rank once, reuses it for
three parallel table stores, and reads the chosen character at +4 from the same
persistent-state base. Caching the rank in one block-local `s32` and spelling
the character as the aggregate field reproduced that identity; repeated rank
reloads plus the standalone character alias caused a broad allocation cascade.
Require both the single index load and the field-offset base in target assembly
before combining these otherwise independent-looking accesses.

The inverse can occur at one site even when the surrounding accesses use the
aggregate. StageEndScreen's inventory-copy loop keeps one `PersistentState`
base for `backup` and `stock`, but the target rematerializes the standalone
`CHOSEN_CHARACTER` alias on every iteration. Spelling that index as
`PSTATE->chr` let cse reuse the aggregate base, deleted the target's independent
`lui`, and retied the `lbu` to that base; mixing
`PSTATE->backup`/`PSTATE->stock` with `CHOSEN_CHARACTER` restored it. Treat the
alias choice as a per-access source decision, not a translation-unit-wide
naming rule.

When a one-use fixed-page pointer still folds into a symbolic load, a
site-local pointer-to-volatile aggregate can preserve its address pseudo so the
base materialization fills an earlier guard's delay slot. Likewise, a pointer
to an extern array that materializes too late can be assigned inside the
minimum exact-extent nested `do { } while (0)` fence: the loop notes preserve
and weight that pointer identity even though no loop survives. StageEndScreen
needed the volatile view for its post-copy stage guard and two zero-trip levels
around the terminal stage-order high-page identity. Expressing the fixed image
address as `0x80090000 - 0x1588`, with the signed low reconstruction delayed
until after the stage uid load, restored the terminal register family even
though the final constant fold still left the `lui`/low-immediate pair as a
two-instruction residual. Recheck the entire caller-register family; these
levers can improve a downstream loop while rotating the setup block.

### A shared `f(0, x)` tail vs two explicit `f(0, lit)` calls place the const arg differently

A shared `f(0, x)` after an if/else hoists one `$a0 = 0` into the merged call's delay
slot; writing TWO explicit per-branch `f(0, literal)` calls keeps `$a0 = 0` in each
predecessor (cross-jump merges only the common `jal` tail, leaving a `nop` delay slot).
Use the two-explicit-calls form when the target materialises a shared constant argument
in each predecessor (`CheckCheatCodes`: 17-byte diff → 2).

### An abs assigned to a variable reaches `abssi2` only as the GE ternary

`dy = (raw >= 0) ? raw : -raw;` folds to ABS_EXPR and expands to ONE `abssi2` insn
writing `dy` (`bgez raw,1f; move dy,raw; negu dy,dy` — negu of the COPY, `raw` dies at
the abs), IN ANY CONTEXT, and the result CAN be a reusable variable. The LT spelling
`(raw < 0) ? -raw : raw` NEVER folds: fold-const.c's COND_EXPR inversion swaps the arms
but then re-binds `arg1` from the already-swapped tree, so the abs check's
`operand_equal_for_comparison_p` misses and expansion takes the branchy singleton path
(`negu dst,src` — the extra-instruction residual). So: spell the abs ternary **GE**.
This supersedes the older "the abs `negu` source is not a C-level choice" note AND the
"reach abssi2 only inline in a comparison" refinement — it is reachable as a plain
`x = (a>=0)?a:-a;` assignment (`SoundEx`, `UpdateMotion`).

The matching build now passes `-fno-builtin` to **cc1**. Consequently an
ordinary `abs(x)` stays a physical library call even when the target has the
same inline `bgez; move; negu` expansion. Use `__builtin_abs(x)` to request the
inline form at that one site without changing the translation unit's flags.
ActKAGI's three-component short-circuit loop required the explicit builtin;
`autorules` applies `builtin-abs`, and `rtlguide` recognizes a candidate
`jal abs` against the target inline sequence as `builtin-abs-inline`. Keep a
plain `abs` call when the retail function really calls the library
(GetVectorLength).

The explicit sign-fix spelling can be a different allocation shape even when
it has the same final branch sequence:

```c
r = param->r;
/* independent statements may intervene */
if (r < 0)
    r = -r;
```

Here `r` is a named pseudo spanning the negative arm. In ProcMiscDoor that
pseudo was globally allocated only after the DoorData index temporaries had
taken `$v0/$v1`, producing a 37-byte register/schedule cascade. Writing
`r = __builtin_abs(param->r);` left the builtin's temporary to local allocation
and made the entire tail exact. `autorules`' `builtin-abs` rule now recognizes
this sign-fix form too: it changes the producer assignment in place and removes
the later `if`, crossing only call-free straight-line expression statements
that do not mention the local. This keeps the original value's evaluation
point and semantics.

The builtin can also preserve a delay-slot `nop` that a manual sign-fix loses.
`__builtin_abs` remains one `abssi2` RTL instruction through reorg and expands
to `bgez; nop; negu` only afterward; a source-level `if (x < 0) x = -x` exposes
the branch early enough for reorg to steal an independent preceding producer
into its delay slot. FUN_80056910 needed the builtin specifically to keep its
preceding sprite-address `addiu` in place and the target `nop` after `bgez`.
When the abs instructions themselves agree but the instruction immediately
before or inside their branch does not, compare `.dbr` rather than respelling
unrelated surrounding statements.

### A conditional store via a pre-branch address copy is one assignment, conditional RHS

`move $v0,$a0` in a branch delay slot feeding `sh …,0($v0)` means the source is ONE
assignment with a conditional right-hand side (`xyz[j] = (cond) ? (t += K) : (t -= K);`),
not two stores. expand_assignment computes the destination address BEFORE expanding the
ternary, and cse folds the recompute into a copy of the earlier load's address register.
Use compound-assignment arms (`t += K`) to keep the value updates in place, and the
ternary's condition may need to re-read the target memory (`xyz[j] < 0` rather than the
equivalent `t < 0`) to keep cse1's taken-path window from canonicalising the store back
onto the original address register (`UpdateMotion`, last 4 bytes).

### Two branch-arm stores through one global pointer need a pre-branch local

When both arms write a field through the same global pointer, spelling the global
directly in each arm can emit one `%gp_rel` load per arm.  Capture it once at the
join instead:

```c
enemy = GetNearestHumanoid(Me_MOTION_C, 3000);
human = Me_MOTION_C;
if (enemy != NULL)
    human->target = (ModelType *)enemy->model;
else
    human->target = NULL;
```

This gives both stores one address pseudo and one load before the condition.  In
AttackControl the direct-global spelling produced two loads plus an extra skip
jump; the local-base spelling, with the non-null arm first to match physical body
order, produced retail's `lw v1,Me_MOTION_C; beqz; ...; sw ...,0x74(v1)` tail
exactly.  Apply only when no intervening call/write can change the global pointer;
the target's single load before the branch is the anti-oracle.

### A read-only decision tree can need direct global tests and a post-join capture

The inverse capture shape is useful when retail performs path-specific scalar
global loads before converging on one cached value. A decompiler may render:

```c
degree = Degree;
if (degree > 0) {
    ...
} else {
    if (degree < 0) ...;
    degree = Degree;
}
use(degree);
```

If the tree has no call, memory store, exit, or update that can change the
nonvolatile extern, test `Degree` directly in both conditions and place the one
`degree = Degree` capture after the join. In Think3escape this restored the
target's path-specific reloads and post-join pseudo. It had to be paired with
widening the later `degree2 = Degree` local from s16 to s32: the capture move
alone made the exact-length draft two instructions short, while the atomic pair
reduced the authoritative checkpoint from `(False,84,29,0)` to
`(False,24,22,0)` at exact length. Guided `deferred-global-capture` proves the
tree is read-only, removes one exact in-tree reload, and emits that coordinated
widening automatically when a later s16 local's sole definition captures a
signed-s16 extern. `rtlguide` includes it early for regalloc, cse/coalescing,
and scheduling residuals so the pair is tried before a blind permuter run.

### The abs idiom's `negu` source register is not a C-level choice

`at = t; if (t < 0) at = -at;` and `at = (t < 0) ? -t : t;` compile identically:
cc1 folds `-at` back to `negu <dst>,<t_reg>`, negating the original `t`, not the
copy. Which register `negu` sources from is a coloring artifact — do not chase it
by respelling the conditional (`UpdateMotion`).

### `arr[idx]` on a top-level extern array expands base-first (ARRAY_REF), not mult-first

An address computation reused across N field stores of `arr[idx]` on a TOP-LEVEL extern
array (a single index, not a compound `arr[a+b*c]` subscript) takes ARRAY_REF's own
base-first expansion, NOT the `EXPAND_SUM` mult-first special case (which fires only for
compound subscripts). So the base symbol's `high`/`lo_sum` gets a LOWER insn UID than the
`idx*stride` offset chain, and local-alloc hands the base first pick of the low scratch
registers -- possibly reversed from the target. This is NOT reachable by the
`(&arr[0])[i]` respelling (that is the struct-member-through-pointer form) nor a cached
pointer local (identical tree post-fold). Bypass ARRAY_REF entirely with a named signed
byte offset followed by an INTEGER pointer sum:

```c
s32 offset;
T *entry;

offset = idx * (s32)sizeof(T);
entry = (T *)(offset + (s32)arr);
```

The separate statement emits the complete multiply/shift chain first; integer addition
preserves the written offset-first operand order, and only then does split-addresses
materialize the extern base. `leSetEnemy` changed from `$v1=base/$a0=offset` to the
target `$v1=offset/$a0=base` and closed its 33-byte residual with this form. A cached
`entry = &arr[idx]` is still ARRAY_REF and remains flat.

**The multi-dimensional extension (LoadConstruction, −21 bytes at two sites):** a
`&arr[i][j][k].field` on a top-level extern array can need the fully-explicit integer
form `(k<<sk) + ((i<<si) + (j<<sj)) + (int)arr`. cc1's ARRAY_REF folds the base symbol
into the offset chain early and emits the outermost index's stride first; the target
instead computes the pure integer offset with the **lowest-stride (innermost) term
first**, the two higher-stride terms **grouped in a parenthesised sub-sum**, and the
base symbol added as a **separate trailing `(int)arr` term**. `&WorldMap[x][y][z].top`
needed `(z<<2) + ((x<<8) + (y<<5)) + (int)WorldMap`; the plain ARRAY_REF and a cached
`entry = &arr[i][j][k]` both stay flat. (Candidate for a future autorules rule — needs
the declared dimensions to derive strides; on the tooling backlog.)

After an address-order fix, recheck nearby stack-parameter loads rather than assuming
the store statements should be written in final machine order. `leSetEnemy` needed
`entry->z = z; entry->r = r;`: the lexical `z` assignment exposes its stack load first,
then sched2 moves the independent `r` store ahead of the `z` store, yielding retail's
physical `r`-then-`z` order. The inverse lexical order left the load one instruction
late. Restrict this to distinct nonvolatile fields with side-effect-free right-hand
sides; otherwise store order is semantic, not a scheduling lever.

`SetupBG` supplied a second exact example: lexical `cell->u = ...; cell->v = py;`
exposes the longer `u` dependency chain first, but sched2 emits the independent `v`
byte store before `u`, as in retail. Writing the stores in target machine order left a
66-byte allocation/schedule residual. When only adjacent independent stores remain,
score both source orders and trust the authoritative linked diff, not visual order.

### Read a stored narrow parameter back to force an independent narrowing identity

When one signed-short parameter feeds both an early division and a much later shift,
directly reusing the parameter can make CSE keep the division's `sll` intermediate live
across the whole region. If the target instead recomputes the sign extension, first
store the parameter in its real destination field and use that field at the later site:

```c
bg->w = w;
/* ... */
bg->mx = bg->w >> 1;
```

In `SetupBG`, cc1 store-forwarded the readback to `w` but expanded a fresh
`move; sll; sra`, so no `lh` survived and the target's independent midpoint identity
appeared. Applying the same form to `h`, while retaining the raw image mode in a
separate `u16` capture until its later mask, fixed the whole early register allocation.
Use this only when the target proves a second narrowing sequence; confirm in assembly
that the field read was forwarded rather than emitted as an extra load.

### Adjacent global banks may need distinct canonical symbols to prevent base folding

When the target materializes two nearby arrays independently but the candidate
turns the second into `first_base + CONSTANT`, CSE has learned that both names
belong to one address expression. Give the second bank its own fixed-address
symbol and use that canonical name in every C file; FUN_8003562c needed
`sprBlood2` rather than expressing the second sprite bank as the first plus
0x90. This is not permission to keep two aliases for one address: DrawBlood's
old `D_800BE9E8` name stopped linking once `sprBlood2 = 0x800be9e8` was pinned,
so the integration fix was to update DrawBlood to the shared canonical symbol.
Separate physical banks; unify source names for the same physical bank.

### Split a computed dereference into address and scalar identities

`value = *(T *)address_expression;` gives cc1 one combined expansion in which
the address pseudo can coalesce with the loaded scalar. When the target keeps
the computed address and value in distinct registers, name both explicitly:

```c
T *value_ptr;
value_ptr = (T *)address_expression;
value = *value_ptr;
```

Think3callaid's AID type lookup is the measured case. The combined signed-s16
load reused `$a0` for the entry address and value, cascading through every
BreedLife argument. A `s16 *type_ptr` restored the table address in `$v0`, the
loaded type in `$a0`, StageID's offset in `$v1`, and the humanoid base in `$a2`,
reducing the exact-length residual from 50 to 37 whole-image bytes.
Guided `deref-address-split` now enumerates exactly this explicit-cast form for
a nonvolatile automatic scalar. It inserts the pointer before that scalar's
declaration (old cc1's declaration-before-statements dialect), rejects calls or
updates in the address, and preserves evaluation order.

### An assignment-expression lvalue can encode pointer publication as a dependency

If a pointer is published to a global and then immediately used to update one
of the pointed object's fields, separate statements can make the publication
and field lvalue independent in RTL even though the game treats them as one
state transition. Preserve the dependency in the lvalue itself:

```c
(Current = (State *)spawned)->attribute |= FLAG;
```

In Think3callaid, this form placed the `Me_THINK_C` store between the attribute
load and update and simultaneously fixed the Think3/Think4 callback colours.
It replaced a decompiler-shaped load-temp, global assignment, and later store.
This is not a blind algebraic rewrite: only move a publication across
side-effect-free straight-line reads/stores whose aliasing is proven, and use
the field from the published pointer's actual type (the unsigned
`character_state` twin, not Humanoid's signed view). Treat it as a guided
source-recovery pattern until the field-offset/type equivalence is mechanical.

### An offset-0 LOCAL-pointer dereference is cse1-canonicalised back to base+const

The sibling of the offset-0-alias `%hi` lever, but for a LOCAL pointer variable and cse
rather than -msplit-addresses. cse1 substitutes a bare offset-0 dereference (`*p` /
`p->field0`) with its defining `base+const` expression (so `sched->next` at offset 0
compiles as `this+24` through the base register, not through `sched`'s own register),
but does NOT do this for the SAME pointer's nonzero-offset fields. So if the target
reaches a struct through a local pointer at offset 0 where your draft goes through the
enclosing base, or vice versa, that is the lever -- confirmed on FUN_8004c59c via the
`.cse`/`.cse2`/`.lreg` dumps (`.greg` shows the pointer correctly in $s1, but cse1 had
already rewritten the offset-0 store to base-relative).

### A spilled pseudo self-ties iff it appears as a BARE OPERAND

**(This section previously read "A huge-offset-spilled pointer dereference can NEVER
self-tie (un-matchable) … AdtSelect is parked on exactly this; do not retry it."
That framing was WRONG and is retracted — see the disproof below. The reload
mechanics it described are literally correct; the DISCRIMINATOR was not.)**

Whether a spilled pseudo can self-tie depends on WHERE THE PSEUDO APPEARS, not on
frame size or offset magnitude:

* **As a bare operand** (`if (title == 0)`, `p = menu`, `menu[i]`) it goes through
  `find_reloads_toplev` and becomes one `RELOAD_FOR_INPUT`, which only checks
  `input_addr[i]` for `i > opnum` — so it **self-ties freely**. `gen_reload` then
  materializes the address into the reload's own destination
  (`ori a3; addu a3,a3,sp; lw a3,0(a3)`) — note this is ONE reload, not a tie
  between two.
* **Inside a MEM** (`menu->choice_name`) it goes through `find_reloads_address`'s
  `reg_equiv_address` branch, which pushes the address-of-the-spill-slot reload
  (`RELOAD_FOR_INPADDR_ADDRESS`) BEFORE the value-used-as-address reload
  (`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT_ADDRESS`); `reload_reg_free_p`'s `RELOAD_FOR_INPUT_ADDRESS`
  case hardcodes a reject on the first reload's register
  (`reload_reg_used_in_inpaddr_addr[opnum]`), and `reload_reg_class_lower`'s
  `return r1 - r2` tiebreak makes the order deterministic. That site is **barred**.

**The same spilled pseudo does BOTH in one function.** AdtSelect reloads `menu`
from the same sp+0x80CC slot at FOUR sites; **three already self-tie and
byte-match** (`p = menu`, the print loop's `menu[i]`, the tail's
`menu[selection]`) and only the offset-0 deref is barred. A criterion that a
function's own matched instructions contradict cannot be a park criterion — and
the frame offset is irrelevant: the demo build's AdtSelect has a different frame
(0x80E0/0x80E4) and emits the same shape.

**Fixing a barred site needs a copy that is SINGLE-USE (so a later fresh read
survives) yet OUTLIVES COMBINE (which folds exactly single-use copies within a
block).** Measured on AdtSelect: a single-use copy is refolded (9); a multi-use
copy survives but eats the second read (764, 3 insns short); an identical-arm
fence is merged by cse1 BEFORE combine (760); `T *volatile p` does emit the
target's load-then-deref at the barred site but makes the pseudo memory-resident
at all four, so the other three stop being bare-operand reloads (51). A real
block boundary would do it, but then the copy's load lands on the far side while
the target's load is adjacent to its deref. **That is the open question — not an
impossibility.**

### A `%hi` reload tie is `combine_regs` refusing to tie a block-crossing pseudo

The "la/address-materialization reload tie" — target keeps a `lui`/`addiu` in the same
register as a call argument, your draft puts the `%hi` temp somewhere else — is
`local-alloc.c`'s `combine_regs` guard: `if (sreg >= FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER &&
reg_qty[sreg] == -1) return 0;`. A pseudo that CROSSES A BLOCK BOUNDARY (e.g. a
`void (*f)(void)` local assigned differently in each if/else arm and used once after the
join) has `reg_qty == -1`, so combine_regs refuses even to attempt tying the `%hi` temp
to it; with no tie and no suggestion, find_free_reg's default ascending search grabs the
first free reg (`$v0`), not the call's `$a0`.

Fix: make the argument pseudo BLOCK-LOCAL — call the function DIRECTLY IN EACH ARM
(duplicated call) instead of funneling a shared local. Then `reg_qty[sreg] != -1`,
combine_regs ties the `%hi` temp to it, the tied qty inherits the call-argument's `$a0`
copy-suggestion (both `lui`/`addiu` halves land in `$a0`), and jump.c's cross-jump merges
the two identical call tails back into the single `jal` the target has — length unchanged.
Do this WITHIN the existing `if/else` — do NOT also convert to an early-return +
fallthrough shape, which can relocate a nearby loop's early-exit block relative to the
call and pull the call's address computation inside `loop.c`'s scanned range (an unwanted
hoist, one instruction short; AfsOpen). This is one of the two classes previously
(wrongly) called permuter-immune; it is
reachable. Now matched by FOUR functions (FileRead, PrepareAccess, AfsOpen + …). Found by a *Sonnet* agent from `rtldump FileRead --draft` + reading
local-alloc.c. Worth retrying `PrepareAccess`'s park with it.

DrawTargetS supplies the adjacent aggregate-call variant. Its target duplicates
`a0 = &line`, the narrowed priority in `a2`, and the OTable load in `a1` across
two conditional arms, but shares the four halfword stores and `jal` after the
join. Assign short-lived `p`, `ot`, and full-width call-priority carriers inside
each arm, then write the aggregate fields and call once after the join. The
branch-local definitions take the argument registers before cross-jump sees the
common store/call suffix; spelling the call directly in each arm, or assigning
all three arguments after the join, lets cc1 merge too much. Use this when the
target's argument setup is duplicated but its physical call tail is not.

### When GE-ternary abs costs bytes elsewhere, absorb the cascade with a scratch reuse

The GE-ternary abs fold (abssi2) is C-correct but can cost bytes elsewhere via a
`global.c` priority cascade (it evicts another local from its target register). Check
whether reusing an EXISTING nearby local as a THROWAWAY scratch for an unrelated value —
BEFORE that local's "real" assignment — absorbs the pressure: extending its pseudo's live
range raises its allocation priority and can fix the cascade AND unrelated ties at once
(`Think1random`: reusing `adx` as scratch for `vx` before its abs role fixed both the
abssi2 cascade and a tied `mfhi $a3` vs `$a2`). The scratch choice matters: pick a
variable whose real role is UNCONDITIONALLY (re)assigned before it is ever read in its
scratch capacity — else it is semantically unsafe (using `result`, whose reset path never
reassigns) or cross-contaminates its own later use (using `adz`).

### A pure callee-saved SWAP residual is an `allocno_compare` inequality — add ballast

When two locals are swapped between `$s0`/`$s1` (or any callee-saved pair) with no other
diff, it is a priority tie in `global.c`'s `allocno_compare`:
`priority = floor_log2(refs) * refs / live_length`, read from the `.lreg` dump's
`Register N used X times across Y insns` lines; the higher priority takes `$s0` first.
Live length counts RTL insns at local-alloc time, so you tilt it by adding an
instruction inside one allocno's live range — hoist a one-arm constant into a variable
defined BEFORE the branch (`maxvol = 0x7f; … dist = maxvol - expr;`): +1 insn to every
allocno live across it, and FREE in bytes when the target materialises that constant in
a register anyway (`SoundEx`: a 14-byte `$s0`/`$s1` swap → 0). Compute the two
priorities from the dump, then add ballast to the one that must win.

### Two same-role temps with DISJOINT live ranges may be ONE reused variable

The exact inverse of the rule above, and also a global-alloc priority lever.
`global.c` sums refs and live-range lengths across a pseudo's whole life, and
priority moves in `floor_log2` jumps, so merging two disjoint temps can vault the
merged pseudo over a rival. `vfree`: the forward-merge's `next->size` (3 refs / 6
insns = 5000) and the backward-merge's `prev->size` (3 / 4 = 7500) are ONE local
`s`; merged they are 6 / 10 = 12000, outranking `next` (4 / 10 = 8000) and pushing
it off `$v1` into `$a0` — the target's exact colouring.

The tell: **the target loads two different values into the SAME register in disjoint
regions** (`lw $v1, 0($a0)` in both merge blocks) while your draft colours them
apart. A `do {} while (0)` wrapper can force the same order, but it cascades (it
boosted `pt` past `header` across a `floor_log2(8)` jump and swapped `$s0`/`$s1`);
a natural variable merge is the stabler lever when one exists.

This applies to long-lived game roles as well as symmetric temps. DamageControl
uses one source local first for the attack id and later for damage severity, and
another across scale/speed/bleed-counter roles; the lifetimes do not overlap, so
the merged pseudos obtain the target's `$s2`/`$s0` homes. A tidier fresh local for
each semantic role lowered/split allocation priority and rotated the saved-register
file. First split decompiler SSA roles for correctness, then deliberately re-merge
only where `.lreg` proves disjoint lives and target asm proves one hard-register
home.

The roles need not even look related. DrawImpact's near-match reused fixed-point
interpolation temporaries in the later projection/priority phase: `inverse` also
carried `pz` (`$a2`), the green/blue start product also carried `py` and the OT
priority temporary (`$v1`), and the end product also carried `px`. Those
byte-neutral reuses cut the exact-length allocator residual to 53 bytes. Use the
target's repeated hard-register identity as the clue, then confirm in `.lreg` that
the phases are actually disjoint; semantic similarity of the variable names is
irrelevant.

### `A + (B + C)` controls which operand receives the constant

fold canonicalises `A + (B + C)` to `(A + C) + B`, so the `addiu` lands on A's
register — where it can fill a guard's delay slot — and the `addu`'s destination
ties to that dying operand. The mirrored spelling emits the same instructions with
swapped operands and a different result colour (`vfree`'s tail sum: `$v1` vs `$v0`).

This is visible across long arithmetic expansions, not only adjacent additions.
`MoveKorogari` needed the constant on `abs(vy) / 2` before cc1 expanded
`rand() % 25`: `A + 25 + B` put 25 on B, and `A + B + 25` emitted it after the
final sum, while **`A + (B + 25)`** produced the target `(A + 25) + B`. When
SequenceMatcher sees that `addiu` once as a deletion and once as an insertion
across the remainder sequence, `rtlguide` now rejoins the pair, classifies it as
`combine/expression`, and reports `constant-add-reassociation` instead of two
false structure/length hunks.

**Now mechanized:** guided autorules rule `plus-group` enumerates the six
association/constant-position trees for exactly two expressions and one integer
literal. It preserves the relative source order of both nonconstant expressions,
so two calls are never exchanged merely to move the literal. Exact byte scoring
chooses the surviving fold tree. Once the baseline has zero length delta,
autorules also rejects any non-matching candidate with a known nonzero length
delta before greedy adoption or beam ranking: a one-instruction shift can make a
large residual's aligned byte score look dramatically better without improving
the function.

StageEndScreen also showed why the right-associated address form is worth trying
after regional accounting: `(character * 0x1d4 + (stage * 0x24 + BASE))`
restored one instruction in an independently one-instruction-short post-game
region. Combined with the scoped final digit base above, all five semantic
regions reached their exact target lengths; this was not accepted as mere
whole-function size compensation.

### A narrowed three-term sum may need a named promoted prefix

An outer `(s16)` can make cse treat every leaf of `A + B + C` as narrow-use-only.
For signed halfword fields that means `lhu` is sufficient until the final
`sll/sra`, and fold is free to accumulate into the last operand's register. If the
target instead has signed `lh` loads and preserves `A+B` in its own register, name
only that promoted seam:

```c
s32 pair;
pair = object[0]->rotate.vy + object[1]->rotate.vy;
arg = (s16)(pair + body->rotate.vy);
```

Do not automatically name the whole three-term result: that extends a different
allocno and can rotate all call-argument registers. In `ControlHumanoid`, the
two-term prefix reduced an exact-length residual from 97 to 57 bytes; a full-sum or
third-leaf temp regressed to 68. Guided/aggressive autorules rule
`add-prefix-temp` now tries both contiguous two-term seams for exactly three
side-effect-free leaves under an explicit signed-16 cast, using a nested C89 block
to bound the temp's lifetime. The generated `_match_sum` is a probe; rename a
winning temp for the domain before committing it.

### Steering allocation: donate a call-arg preference to a low-priority pseudo

`global.c`'s `find_reg` makes earlier (higher-priority) allocnos AVOID a free
register that a later allocno *prefers*. So you can push a high-priority pseudo off
a free `$a2` and into `$a3` by donating an `$a2` call-argument preference to a
low-priority pseudo — e.g. by merging that pseudo with a call-argument temp whose
live range is disjoint. This is the lever when a same-length register rotation has
no C-level fix. Found by reading `-dg` on `vrealloc`: pseudo 85 was the top-priority
allocno with an explicit `preferences: 6` (hard `$a2`) inherited from the give-up
path's `memcpy` third argument; it took `$a2` first and rotated everything after it.
Run `tools/regalloc.py <Name> --prefer a2` to list only allocnos carrying that
preference, their final register, priority, and call-crossing count. SaveSI used
disjoint later calls as deterministic preference donors for reused copy-loop
roles (`src`→`$a0`, `dst`→`$a1`, alignment/result→`$v1`, third icon→`$a2`,
end/result→`$v0`). The donor need not remain adjacent in final assembly; it is
the merged pseudo and `.greg` preference edge that matters.

Duplicating one call in existing mutually exclusive arms is a related donor
lever: each source call can keep a block-local result preference, while jump2
cross-merges the identical output back to one physical call. SaveSI combined
that with a block-local duplicate of the symbol-address producer and a one-shot
loop fence, fixing a `%hi` coalescing/schedule tie without a surviving branch.

### A shared-return `sra` above the epilogue restores means a SECOND `return`

If the epilogue's truncating `sra` sits ABOVE the `lw` register restores (target)
but your build emits `[lw restores][sra]`, the source had a second literal `return`
statement. sched2 runs BEFORE jump2/cross-jump in this cc1 (verified: the `.jump2`
dump already carries sched2's dependency lists), so with a single structured return
the `[sll][sra][use]` flows into the threaded epilogue as one block and sched2 sinks
the `sra` below the restores (the loads have longer latency chains to the blockage
insn). A second `return` makes `expand` jump to `return_label`, whose CODE_LABEL pins
the `sra` above the loads at sched2 time; cross-jump then deletes the duplicated
`[sll][sra][use][jump]` body and jump2 re-inverts the guard, so the early return
costs nothing elsewhere. Constraint: place the early-return site so its inline body
does NOT sit between two blocks sharing a cse'd value (a shared `lhu` of a global, a
shared struct-pointer load) — cse follows only the fallthrough path
(`turn_towards_player_`; its `cached != 0x80000000` guard is the unique safe site).

`Think3attack` independently confirmed the same signature at an ordinary
value-producing early edge: changing `goto return_pad;` to `return pad;` moved
only the final `sra`, closing a 10-byte residual with no surviving extra code.
`rtlguide` reports this exact epilogue permutation as
`shared-return-extension-schedule`; guided `autorules` then enumerates
`shared-return-split` only for gotos whose destination immediately returns.
The residual's source line normally belongs to the final return, so the rule
uses that label line to admit the distant goto without opening a global CFG
search.

The second return can also be a value-producing call already assigned in a
terminal branch. In `Think3hitaway`, the target's status-7 edge needed
`return SuccessionAttack(...)`, not `result = SuccessionAttack(...)` followed
by the common return: the direct form left the result in `$v0` and started the
s16 conversion in the jump delay slot, closing a 14-byte schedule residual.
Direct-returning the sibling `AttackFunc` arm had previously regressed, so try
the edge named by the target's value flow rather than assuming all call arms
are interchangeable. Guided `terminal-call-return` enumerates these edges only
when a call assignment is terminal through every enclosing arm, the top-level
conditional is immediately followed by `return result`, and the unaddressed
local/function return widths agree.

### cse2 ignores loop notes; evict a merged `&local` arg by reassigning a pointer

`cse1` ends its basic block at `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END` but `cse2` does NOT, so a
`do {} while (0)` protects a value from cse1 only. When cse2 keeps folding a repeated
`&local` call-argument onto an earlier call's argument pseudo (the target
re-materialises `addiu $aN,$sp,N` fresh each time), evict the register from cse's
value class by threading one pointer variable through the call sites:
`f(.., pv = &vc, ..); f(.., pv = &vd, ..); pv = 0;` — each reassignment drops `pv`
from the previous value's class, and the dead `pv = 0;` (flow deletes it, zero bytes)
evicts the last, so the later `&vc`/`&vd` arguments find no equivalent register and
rebuild the address (`SetCameraMode`).

### Put a fallthrough producer after a returning guard to make it the delay slot

When a conditional branch returns on its taken edge and the target puts an
arithmetic producer in that branch's delay slot, write the producer as the first
statement *after* the returning `if`:

```c
if (special) {
    handle_special();
    return;
}
timer = chase + STEP;
chase = timer;
```

The producer is valid only on the fallthrough path, so reorg can steal it into
the returning branch's delay slot. Hoisting `timer = ...` before the guard may
be value-equivalent when the special edge discards it, but it extends the
producer's lifetime across the test; cc1 may instead fill the slot from a later
comparison and leave the function one instruction long. In
`death_camera_something_`, keeping the timer add after the attribute-return
guard was the source-level cause of the target `addiu` delay slot and the exact
following store/clamp schedule.

Do not "repair" the resulting signed arithmetic by flipping its local to
unsigned. If a value is explicitly compared with zero or used as the left
operand of `>>`, the target's `bltz`/negative correction and `sra` encode signed
semantics. `autorules type-width` now vetoes signed-to-unsigned candidates at
those sites while still trying width changes that preserve signedness.

### An "unconditional" delay-slot move after a compare is NOT a comma-expression

reorg steals the fallthrough arm's first instruction into a conditional branch's
delay slot whenever the written register is dead on the taken path, so a plain
`if (a && b != K) { x = K; ... }` produces the identical "executed on both paths"
placement that a comma-expression `(x = K, b != K)` would. Check register deadness on
the taken path before reaching for the comma spelling — the comma form assigns `x`
too early and changes the allocation (`turn_towards_player_`; the parked draft had
been blocked by exactly this misreading).

### Sink a pre-guard flag assignment onto both edges to expose one delay-slot definition

When a flag is assigned immediately before a rejecting guard, these two shapes
are semantically equivalent for a nonvolatile local that the condition does not
read:

```c
done = true;
if (kind != EXPECTED) {
    goto check_done;
}
```

```c
if (kind != EXPECTED) {
    done = true;
    goto check_done;
}
done = true;
```

The edge-local spelling begins both definitions after the comparison. jump/reorg
can merge them into the comparison branch's delay slot, while the pre-guard form
usually materialises the flag before the compared value. This was ActDAMAGE's
last instruction-placement residual. Combined with a narrow (`short`) flag, it
also preserved the retail join copy and kept an unrelated call's literal `1`
from reusing the flag's saved register.

Guided `autorules` exposes both directions as `guard-flag-assign`, restricted to
an adjacent literal 0/1 (or false/true), a compound single-`goto` guard, a
nonvolatile non-address-taken local, and a call/macro-free condition containing
only known locals or parameters. It also rejects call-like uses of the flag and
locally defined macro expansions that name it: before preprocessing,
`#define REJECT (done && reject)` hides the read from an AST-only check, while
`CAPTURE(done)` may hide `&done`. Unary-address detection follows parentheses
and comments, so `&(done)` cannot hide an alias read in the guard. `rtlguide`
prioritises the rule for regalloc and schedule/delay residuals.

### `x |= C; store x;` vs `store = x | C;` is a local-alloc lever

The expression form creates a fresh or-temp whose refs/length priority beats a
longer-lived sibling temp in the same block, rotating which one gets `$v0` and
cascading into a global pseudo's colouring. The in-place compound leaves the sibling
alone (`turn_towards_player_`: in-place `d2 |= 0x1e` kept `Me_THINK_C` in `$v0` and
`d2` in `$v1`; the expression form pushed both).

### A `li` in a branch delay slot means the constant was defined in that test's block

Signature: `lw / nop / bltz / lui`, i.e. a constant `li` sitting in a conditional
branch's delay slot with a load-use hazard `nop` before the branch. That means the
constant's definition lived in that test's OWN basic block — the source assigned it
*between* two tests of what looks like a single `&&` chain. Write nested `if`s with a
`goto` to the shared else, not one `&&`. sched1 slots the `li` into the load-delay
stall, reorg pulls it into the branch slot, and the assembler re-inserts the hazard
`nop`. Spelling the constant literally per-arm instead compiles TWO `lui`s: cse's
path-following cannot unify constants across divergent arms (`vrealloc`'s
`0x80000000`).

### Define a boolean after each arm's comparisons to reuse their result register

`flag = 0; if (outer) { flag = 1; if (inner) ... }` makes `flag` live across
both comparison pseudos, so global allocation cannot put it in their `$v0`.
When the target uses `$v0` for each `slt`, then writes `move v0,zero` / `li v0,1`
in the corresponding branch delay slots, put each definition after the work
whose comparison it can reuse:

```c
if (outer) {
    if (inner)
        update();
    flag = 1;
} else {
    flag = 0;
}
```

The assignments execute on the same paths, but their RTL live ranges now begin
after the tests. reorg can place both definitions in the delay slots with no
register conflict (ProcItemNinken's final three-byte tie). `rtlguide` reports
`post-comparison-flag-definition`; guided `autorules` can try the bounded
`flag-arm-assign` rewrite only when the local is nonvolatile, the arm does not
read it, and no early exit can bypass the moved assignment.

The reverse spelling is a separate control-flow lever.  If retail falls through
the false path while the candidate has an unconditional jump around `else`, use
the pre-zero form:

```c
flag = 0;
if (value < 0) {
    value = -value;
    flag = 1;
}
```

In `mission_score_screen`, a physical CFG audit showed 14 candidate
unconditional jumps versus eight in retail.  The first three decimal expansions
and the row loop use the two-arm form, but the next six pre-zero the sign flag;
preserving those as two macro variants made the inventory exactly 8/8 without
changing behavior.  That macro split and the affected invocation routing were
applied manually: current `autorules` operates on explicit function-body
statements and does not clone macro definitions or redirect their call sites.

For explicit statements, `flag-arm-assign` now enumerates the reverse rewrite
only for an unshadowed, nonvolatile function-scope local with a single
default-only false arm and the opposite 0/1 override at the true arm's end.  It
follows unary `&` through parentheses and rejects early exits, calls, macro
names, unknown identifiers, or direct/aliased flag observations in the
condition and true-arm prefix.  These restrictions matter because moving the
default across either region can otherwise change what a call, macro expansion,
or pointer alias sees.  Continue to review macro bodies manually, and do not
blindly normalize sibling expansions when their target CFGs differ.

A literal coordinate inside those expansions can also be a control-flow
carrier. For the four two-arm signed-normalization draws, retail keeps the Y
literal in a fresh full-width register and places the sprite Y store in the
`bgez` delay slot. A direct literal store was scheduled before the branch and
let `jump2` delete the negative arm's unconditional jump. Giving only those
macro expansions a fresh block-local `s32` Y carrier restored the delay-slot
store and three missing jumps without changing extent. Route this by expansion:
adding the carrier to every repeated copy rotates the shared saved-register
family and is not equivalent source evidence.

### Split a path-produced result from the final flag at its CFG join

A target sequence such as `move v1,v0; move v0,v1; beqz v0,...` is not random
redundancy.  It records two distinct pseudos: a value produced only by the
computed paths is copied into the flag that all paths test.  If the candidate
has only `move v1,v0; beqz v1,...`, cc1 has coalesced those roles.

Keep the entry/default result and the path-computed result separate, and funnel
only the computed paths through one join before assigning the final flag:

```c
if (entry_case) {
    active = initial_active;
    goto active_done;
}
computed_active = expensive_path_test();
computed_active_done:
active = computed_active;
active_done:
if (active) ...
```

This is a CFG and liveness lever, not merely a rename.  In `ActivateHumans` it
recovered the target's path-result register and first join copy, reducing the
draft from 1,004 to 740 differing bytes while retaining the exact 1,608-byte
length and 0x68-byte frame.  The compiler still coalesced the final reverse
copy, so do not escalate automatically to `volatile`: confirm the copy chain in
`.lreg`/`.greg`, try at most a bounded zero-code liveness fence, and park a flat
result.  `rtlguide` detects this narrow residual as `path-result-copy-join`.

### Which zero-initialised local is the "master" decides the whole allocation

When several locals are zeroed together, one is literally assigned the constant and
the rest are copied from it. Which one is discoverable from the register the first
`move`/`li` of the init chain targets. Get it wrong and a local can collide with a
still-live incoming parameter's register, forcing an extra callee-saved save/restore
across the whole function. `GetCenterAndSize` zeroes six shorts; naming the wrong
master put one of them in the live `center` parameter's register. Reordering the
declarations so the master matches the asm's first-in-chain register fixed it with no
other change. The tell is `regalloc.py` showing a parameter's register reused by a
local.

### A parameter that walks stays in its incoming register; the fixed base gets copied

When two live pointers into one buffer are a fixed base plus a walking cursor, cc1
keeps the **incoming parameter register** as the walker and copies the fixed base to
a fresh callee-saved register. In `LoadTIMpack`, writing `puVar2 = adr;` and then
walking `adr` (`adr = adr + 1`) while reading the fixed base through `puVar2` matched
the target's register roles. Walking `puVar2` instead — keeping `adr` fixed — rotated
every callee-saved register by one and mismatched the whole prologue and epilogue.
Pick which name walks to match the target's `$a0` role, not for readability.

### A struct-typed local cached at a post-branch join, not at entry

Two sibling field checks that straddle an intervening conditional block will each
reload the base pointer, because a label is a hard CSE boundary. Naive hoisting to
function entry does not fix it — but a **named local** whose liveness crosses the
label does. `ItemUse` needed `character_state *me = Me_THINK_C;` introduced right at
the join, so `item[1]` and `item[4]` reuse one register across the branch instead of
reloading twice.

### A constant used ONCE across a call is rematerialised, not allocated

cc1 costs a cheap constant that is live across a call as *rematerialisable*: it
re-emits it at the point of use rather than paying a callee-saved register plus
the prologue/epilogue save. If the target clearly keeps such a value in `$s2`
across a call and your draft re-materialises it, **use the same named constant a
second time somewhere else in the function** — a second use tips the cost model
into giving it a real register. (`vfree`'s `mask` needed to appear in both the
double-release guard and the forward-merge test to land in `$s2`.)

### Statement order steers which value gets tail-duplicated at a goto-merge

The "source statement order steers scheduling" family has a second, distinct
member: at a merge point reached by several `goto`s, cc1 duplicates *one* of the
values computed before it into each predecessor and computes the other once.
Which one it picks is decided by **textual order**, and it can pick backwards.

With `r = col >> 16;` written before `fp = &ef->param.bleed;`, cc1 duplicated the
path-*invariant* `r` onto both merge-entry paths and computed the necessarily
path-*dependent* `fp` once — the opposite of the target. Swapping the two
statements (address first) fixed both at once (SetBleed). If a diff shows one
value duplicated across predecessors and another that "should" be, try reordering
their definitions before reaching for the permuter.

### Adjacent literal field stores are a bounded scheduling permutation

Two adjacent nonvolatile stores such as `frame->size = 0x3000;
frame->mode = 0;` have the same final state in either order, but sched2 can use
their source order to break a later independent scheduling tie. In
FUN_80037e0c, putting `mode` first fixed the final eight-byte tail residual even
though both stores themselves already aligned. Guided `autorules` exposes only
this narrow safe form as `adjacent-field-store-swap`: same base, distinct
fields, literal RHSes, and no intervening statement. Broader store permutations
can alias or move side effects and remain out of bounds.

- **Source liveness across a call wins over the final scheduled position.** A
  value assigned immediately before a projection/helper call can be scheduled
  to an instruction after that call, yet its pseudo still crosses the call and
  therefore forces a callee-saved register and a larger frame. Moving the
  assignment after the call may make the visible instruction order look the
  same while deleting that saved register. DrawBlood and FUN_8003562c both
  needed the source-before-call form; use `regalloc.py`/stackplan to decide,
  not the final instruction address alone. SaveCard is the smaller inverse-
  looking example: assigning `chan = 0` before the third `GetArcData` call lets
  sched move that definition after the call but before the `$v0` result copy.
  Writing it where the final assembly appears loses that schedule.

- **A pre-call narrow capture plus post-call widening separates a raw saved
  copy from its later mask.** When the target first copies an incoming word
  argument into an `$s` register, carries it across calls, and only then emits
  `andi saved,saved,0xff`, write `u8 narrow = raw_arg;` before the calls and
  `u32 raw = narrow;` afterwards. The narrow pseudo is live across the calls,
  but the widening site keeps the raw argument copy and the mask as distinct
  target instructions. An in-place `raw_arg &= 0xff` after the calls can rotate
  the other saved-argument stores; moving that same mask before the calls lets
  combine collapse `move` + `andi` into `andi saved,arg` and makes the function
  one instruction short. This exact split closed FUN_8005778c while preserving
  its 388-byte extent and the full downstream `$s0` lifetime.

- **A named `zero` local can flip a pure register-swap tie — cheaper than the
  permuter.** Comparing a loop bound against a `zero` local (`int zero = 0; …
  while (n > zero)`) rather than the literal `0` shifts global-alloc's
  pseudo-number tie-break enough to swap two coalesced registers with no other
  effect — plausible as a real sentinel/bound local. Try it before reaching for
  `tools/permute.py` on a ≤-few-byte register-swap residual (GetArcData).

### A `goto`-label's placement decides which copy keeps the source's register

cse's `make_regs_eqv` (cse.c) will rewrite later uses of `x` to a copy `flag = x`
*only if* `flag`'s live range ends both **beyond the block** and **later than
`x`'s**. The C-level lever is **creation order**: placing the hit-handler block
(the `goto hit;` target) *after* the after-loop check extends the handler-set
variable's range past `x`'s, so the store keeps `x`'s register instead of the
copy's. Moving the labelled block earlier/later flips which of two coalesced
values owns the register (ProcItemSmoke's hit handler). Same family as "statement
order steers tail-duplication," but the knob is *label position*, not def order.

### `optimize_reg_copy_1` propagates a copy within a block; a `do{}while(0)` walls it off

local-alloc's `optimize_reg_copy_1` propagates `[copy dest,src] … [src REG_DEAD]`
by rewriting src→dest across the block, and its scan **stops only at JUMP/LABEL/
LOOP notes** — plain statement order does not stop it, because sched1's REG_DEAD
rank-boost hoists the copy regardless of where you write it. So when the target
keeps the copy un-propagated (two live registers, not one), the only source-level
barrier is a real basic-block edge between the copy and the death: wrap that span
in `do { … } while (0);` (its back-edge note halts the scan). Reach for this when
a draft collapses two registers into one that the target keeps distinct
(ProcItemSmoke).

The fence can be **local**, around one conditional scan rather than the whole
function. ActATTACK wraps each `if (MotionUpdateMode) { for (...) ... }` scan in
a one-shot `do`; the loop notes prevent the unwanted load/copy propagation and
change weighted reference order, while optimized output gains no branch. Guided
`autorules` now enumerates eligible `if`, `for`, and `while` statements as
`loop-fence`. It rejects an `if` containing `break` or `continue`, because the new
wrapper could capture those statements; byte scoring still decides whether an
otherwise safe fence helps.

An assignment alone can be the fenced span. LoadSI's `msg = 0` normally
propagated the literal directly into later card calls and delayed the real
`$s1 = 0` definition into a branch slot. Wrapping only that assignment in a
one-shot `do` stopped the constant/copy propagation, scheduled the definition
before `valloc`, and made `$s1` feed `MemCardAccept`/`MemCardSync`, with no
surviving branch. This is already an ordinary guided `loop-fence` candidate;
the RTL symptom is one missing long-lived zero pseudo, not a wrong constant.

The fence can follow a narrowing store while the value itself remains
full-width. ComPad needs `pad->held = raw; do {} while (0);` followed by two
identical branch-local `int` copies of `raw`. The loop note anchors the store
and stops local copy propagation, so cc1 retains `sh v0; move v1,v0`; only the
later bit test narrows with `andi`. Making the producer or branch copy `u16`
moves the zero-extension onto the copy, while omitting the fence lets reorg
steal the store into the test branch's delay slot. Use this measured trio when
the target has a full-width producer, a narrow memory publish, then a plain
register copy before the first explicitly narrow consumer.

A narrow round trip can make the fence erase an unwanted constant equivalence
without adding final instructions:

```c
raw = 0;
short_value = raw;
do { } while (0);
if (discriminator)
    raw = (s32)short_value;
else
    raw = (s32)short_value;
```

AttackShort's HImode store plus loop notes prevent CSE from tagging the widened
`raw` as literal zero. The identical arms retain a real pre-`jump2` CFG, then
disappear; global allocation coalesces the round trip in `$s0`. Consequently an
earlier `v0 = 0` island no longer cross-jumps with later `v0 = raw` edges, while
both final edges are plain moves. Capture any already-loaded pointer used after
the fence in a short-lived local before it: otherwise the loop notes can turn a
zero-code value fence into one extra reload, as the first AttackShort probe did.

The same fence works for a nonzero signed return constant. SearchTarget assigns
`-2` to an SImode local, narrows it through an HImode local, crosses the empty
one-shot loop, and widens it in identical arms selected by an already-live
`short` mode. No instruction from the fence survives, but the widened result is
no longer tagged as the literal used by an earlier close-distance return.
`jump2` therefore keeps the target's late passage-failure `j`/`li -2` island
while folding the close return into its conditional branch. This removed the
last extra instruction and all 88 differing bytes from the 1,128-byte function;
use the round trip on the return whose island must survive, not necessarily on
the first or zero-valued return.

A producer can sit inside the fenced assignment's **comma RHS** when the
residual is only instruction order: `do { table[1] = (offset = i * 4, 58); }
while (0);`.  This keeps the literal definition and store on opposite sides of
the producer in RTL without adding runtime control flow.  InitEffect's A/B was
exact and local: separate statements produced either `li; sw; sll` or
`sll; li; sw`, while the comma form alone produced the target `li; sll; sw`.
Reserve this for independent nonvolatile local assignments whose final values
and later uses are unchanged; moving an effectful call, volatile access, or
possibly aliasing store into a comma expression is not semantics-preserving.

An expression fence can also supply exactly one allocator-priority weight.
ProcMiscDoor's final three-byte tie had `t` at 3 refs / 5 live insns (priority
6000) below `angle` at 3 / 4 (7500); `regalloc.py --compare 217 218` reported
that one weighted ref was sufficient. A one-shot loop around only the ratan2
assignment emitted no control-flow instruction, raised `t` above `angle`, and
let `t`, `angle`, and the later `dir` reuse `$v0` at disjoint lifetimes. Prefer
the smallest `rtlguide`-selected expression fence when the comparison says one
weight is enough; broader loops can perturb unrelated scheduling.

Fence depth is itself a bounded allocator lever when one reference is not enough.
`AddEnemy` needed a deeply nested single-trip fence only around `i = count` at the
boundary between its two scan phases; all levels vanished after jump2, but the
weighted reused `i` range outranked `count` and recovered `$s4`/`$s5`. Smaller
depths were flat, while fencing the inner increment changed the loop CFG. Increase
depth only against measured `.lreg` priority, keep the fence on the smallest pure
assignment, and recheck exact extent plus the whole caller-register family after
every step.

Sometimes the target needs only the **post-LOOP_END scheduler barrier**, not the
enclosed reference weight. Insert a standalone `do { } while (0);` *between*
the producer and consumer in that case. Its empty body contributes no weighted
references, while sched still gives the first following instruction the full
pending-register/pending-memory dependency. CameraDirection supplied the
direct A/B: no boundary made the draft one instruction short; wrapping
`CamLoc.vx -= sin` restored the schedule but reweighted `sin` and exchanged its
saved-register home with `cos`; an empty loop immediately after that assignment
restored the 215-instruction retail length without the register exchange.
SetupImageToPolyFT4's exact empty boundary after `y += ph` is the earlier
independent example. Guided `empty-loop-boundary` now enumerates this
weight-free fence at adjacent statement boundaries; use ordinary `loop-fence`
when the enclosed value really does need more allocation priority.

The boundary can partition a **producer phase** rather than the two visibly
swapped instructions. FUN_8005e8f0 needed `lui/ori magic; lui base; addiu
cursor; sw magic`. Naming the magic literal, placing an empty one-shot loop
immediately after its assignment, then spelling base setup, cursor advance,
and store separately produced that exact order. A boundary after the base
assignment moved its `lui` ahead of the magic pair; a boundary after the store
forced `sw` ahead of `addiu`. When a two-insn tie stays flat, split the shared
producer first and enumerate boundaries around the producer/consumer phases,
not just between the two final instructions.

The producer boundary can compose with a **call-only one-shot loop** when
reorg is choosing between a fall-through call argument and a duplicated
branch-target instruction. LoadTIMpack was one instruction short because the
CLUT guard stole `&rect` into its delay slot instead of duplicating the shared
`i + 1`. Naming the CLUT pointer, placing an empty boundary after that load,
and wrapping only `LoadImage(&rect, clut)` in `do { ... } while (0)` restored
the retail 69-instruction extent and exact CFG, reducing the guarded residual
to 12 bytes. Wrapping the geometry assignments too erased the gain; placing a
boundary inside them changed their allocation. Treat the pointer-producer and
call range as separate axes, and verify the resulting argument/field register
island even when branch reorg becomes exact.

An artificial fence is a hypothesis, so re-test its **removal after every real
identity/dependency fix**. Think3callaid first needed an empty loop between its
Think1Func and Think2Func stores to restore a missing load-delay `nop`. After
the true possession/attribute assignment-expression dependency was recovered,
that same fence became the final eight-byte mismatch; removing it naturally
put `move $a0,$s0` in Think1's delay slot and left the target `nop` after
Think2. `empty-loop-boundary` now emits removal candidates for existing empty
one-shot loops as well as insertion candidates, so a guided/greedy resweep can
discard diagnostic scaffolding automatically.

A redundant write to an **unobserved automatic aggregate** can be an allocation
donor too. CameraDirection's bounded permuter first repeated
`target.vrx = CamLoc.vx - r.vx` after the neighbouring `vpx`/`vry`
initialisers, reducing the exact-size residual from 72 to 56 bytes. Once
mechanised, exhaustive local scoring found the stronger `target.vpx` repeat at
the same boundary (72→47). cse removed the second store in both cases, so
function length and behaviour were unchanged, but its temporary references
re-coloured the tail. Guided `redundant-field-donor` tries that narrow shape
across one to three sibling field initialisers. It requires a nonvolatile,
non-address-taken local aggregate, direct `.` fields, a
call/update/dereference-free RHS using only automatic locals, and no
intervening non-field statement. This is not permission to duplicate pointer,
global, volatile, or call-bearing assignments: those writes may be observable,
and a retained extra store is a structure regression rather than evidence.

Donors are not permanent in isolation: after adding a second proven-safe donor,
re-score the old fence and the source order of nearby automatic-aggregate
initialisers as one bounded set. A later CameraDirection pass combined the vpx
and vrx donors, removed the now-counterproductive nested loop around the output,
and initialized the local `SVECTOR` in vx/vy/vz order. That moved the exact-size
checkpoint from 47 to 17 linked bytes. The six possible field orders were cheap
enough to exhaust (the other five scored 19--44), while a subsequent
100-candidate RTL-guided rule sweep found no result below 17. The lesson is not
to permute whole functions: exhaust a tiny, semantically independent aggregate
store group when sched1 shows those stores feeding the residual, then re-test
diagnostic allocation scaffolding because the new pseudo order can supersede it.

The fence may need to cover a **contiguous producer/consumer range**, not one
AST statement. AttackIndirect's final copy-propagation tie closed only when one
`do { ... } while (0)` enclosed three adjacent `if` statements together; fencing
any member alone did not create the needed note boundary around the whole live
range. Guided `autorules` therefore also enumerates `loop-range`: two-to-four
adjacent statements, excluding declarations and any nested break/continue/case/
label whose target or scope could change. This is a bounded RTL-line-guided
search, not permission to scatter dummy loops blindly.

ActACTION gives the delay-slot version of the same rule. Without a fence,
sched2/reorg duplicated `li 0x7fff` into two predecessor branch delay slots and
kept a third copy at the join, making the function one instruction long; the
target has `nop` in both delay slots and one literal beside the eventual mask
store. Fencing only `motion->mask = 0x7fff` stopped the duplication but left the
two global pointer loads reversed. The exact range was the complete dependency
chain, `motion = dtM; human = Me_MOTION_C; motion->mask = 0x7fff;`, in one
`do`/`while (0)`. `rtlguide` reports this strong assembly fingerprint as
`dbr-duplicated-literal-producer` and puts `loop-range` first. Confirm the
transition in `.sched2` -> `.dbr`; work backward from the consumer to include
its contiguous producers rather than fencing only the visibly duplicated
literal.

`paired-loop-fence` is the atomic complement: it splits two-to-four adjacent
statements into two separate one-shot loops. DrawConstruction needed both
slot/plimit fences together to keep two allocation priorities ordered; either
alone crossed a rival priority or created a target-absent scheduler `nop`. The
paired rule lets scoring see the combination without requiring a regressing
intermediate beam state. Single `loop-fence` also accepts a plain expression
statement, covering LoadSI's exact `msg = 0` fence.

Loop weighting and expression splitting can be one allocation operation rather
than two independent cleanups. ControlHumanoid first needed three weights on a
final `direction = (target_y - y) / 2` to put `direction` in `$v1`; splitting the
same expression through the now-dead, same-type `magnitude` local then donated
the numerator's `$a0` preference and reduced the exact-length residual from 42
to 17 bytes:

```c
magnitude = target_y - y;
direction = magnitude / 2;
```

The inserted assignment still vanished. In this accepted case the pre-split
RTL recorded `REG_EQUAL (div:SI ...)`, and both candidate and target used the
signed bias-plus-`sra` sequence for division by two; the field expression's
signed division was therefore established independently of the rewrite.

Guided `dead-host-split` mechanically tries a deliberately safer subset of this
composition. Destination and host must be unaddressed, nonvolatile,
function-scope signed-32 scalars of the same type; the host must have an earlier
use and no later source occurrence; and `(A +/- B) / literal` must have a
provably signed numerator (signed-32 locals/parameters or an explicit signed
cast) and divisor. It rejects a function containing `goto`, a labeled loop, a
repeating-loop ancestor, or any later call-like token that is not a declared C
function and could therefore be a local-capturing macro. Existing one-shot
weighting loops are allowed. These conservative guards mean the rule need not
fire retroactively on ControlHumanoid's raw field expression and earlier gotos;
they keep future automatic probes semantics-preserving. Do not reuse a merely
*apparently* dead local by hand when control-flow re-entry, unsigned conversion,
macro capture, address escape, or a later iteration can observe the new value.

When one value needs more than one unit of loop weight, `nested-loop-fence`
tries two and three nested one-shot loops as one candidate. This avoids making
a beam discover a useful depth through a neutral or regressing single wrapper.
FUN_8005b17c needed two nested weights on `scan = text` to place its four
call-crossing values in `s0`/`s1`/`s2`/`s3` order.

### Inline extended asm is an anti-rule, not a matching transformation

An empty compiler barrier can make old GCC retain a desired copy without
emitting an instruction, but it encodes no recovered game logic and is too easy
to use as an opaque register-allocation escape hatch. Do not land it in a
matching function. If an experiment containing inline asm is the only known
match, keep the function nonmatching (or park the experiment) and continue
working backward from `.rtl`, `.lreg`, `.greg`, and `.jump2` to a real C cause.

StateTransition is the worked correction: its experimental barriers were
removed and the exact match recovered with repeated field access, relational
polarity, a real referenced `case` label, and a one-shot `do` that supplies the
needed loop notes. Those constructs explain source-level intent and survive
review; a synthetic clobber does not.

`autorules` contains no asm-producing rule, and `rtlguide` never recommends one.
`matchdiff` also treats an otherwise byte-exact result as incomplete while its
source still contains a `NON_MATCHING` guard, `INCLUDE_ASM` fallback, or inline
`__asm__`; it returns failure until the unconditional plain C is rebuilt and
verified. This prevents an exact shadow draft from being committed as “matched”
while the default executable still links retail assembly. The final link map,
not the current source text, proves which body supplied the bytes: immediately
after removing a guard, `asmdiff -n` can otherwise reuse the PREVIOUS default
build's `<Name>.NON_MATCHING` stub and report a false exact sequence. Both
`matchdiff` and `asmdiff` now reject that map marker even if the source has
already become plain C (ActSQUAT exposed the stale-artifact path).
A target-only move is reported only as a register goal for inspecting the
candidate's copy chain. This is a deliberate stopping rule: exact bytes are the
verification gate, but they do not make an arbitrary compiler directive a
credible decompilation.

### A search-flag's initialiser placement flips it callee- vs caller-saved

`found = 0;` written at the **top of the search loop** is loop-invariant → loop.c
hoists it into the preheader → the flag survives the loop body's calls and goes
callee-saved ($s), shifting the whole allocation. Written **inside the
exhaust/break arm** instead, it stays caller-saved and reorg can steal its `li`
into the exit branch's delay slot. Pick the placement that matches where the
target's flag lives (ProcItemLaunch/Smoke search loops).

### A block copy through `*p` coalesces the copy cursor across a multi-pred join

`rparam = *p;` (copy the pointee) lets the block-move's source cursor coalesce
with the pointer variable across a multi-predecessor label (`case 2: case 4:`),
matching a target that reuses the pointer register as the copy source;
`rparam = param;` (copy a named aggregate) re-materialises the source address
after the join and adds an `addiu`. When a struct-assignment's source register
should be the incoming pointer itself, spell it as `*p` (ProcItemLaunch).

### reorg deletes a same-address reload only if the register is untouched between

`reorg`/`dbr` (delay-branch, post-allocation) does redundant-insn elimination: a
`[sw R,x … lw R,x]` pair with **R never redefined between** collapses to just the
store — cse/combine never fold these (they're a pure coloring/reorg interaction;
verified absent from `.cse`/`.cse2`/`.combine`). So when the target KEEPS a
"redundant" reload (e.g. re-reading `p->end.*` after storing it), the stored
register must be REDEFINED in the interval — funnel the stored values through one
serially-reused temp (`t = v.vx; p->end.vx = t; t = v.vy; …`) so R is live-again
and reorg can't delete the reload. Conversely, to make a reload vanish, keep its
register untouched across the span. ReqItemUse's lightningbolt end-vector tail
initially exposed a tension between this rule and the required coloring order;
it was resolved by turning the tail's values into function-scope pseudos and
giving them byte-neutral uses in a later case (see the multi-anchor rule below).
Note: a `sz = 0;`-style dead def can't steer this —
`delete_trivially_dead_insns` runs post-cse and the ref counts are recomputed
before local-alloc, so the def is gone before it can bias anything.

A caller-saved base that genuinely survives a call can require an explicit source
spill rather than a callee-saved local. Store the pointer as a 32-bit word in an
address-taken scratch object before the call, then reload it through a volatile
word view after the call. The ordinary store remains schedulable (in `AddEnemy`,
the second of two base spills fills `sprintf`'s `jal` delay slot), while the
volatile read retains the post-call reload and starts a new pseudo. Making the
store volatile pins it too early; making the reload ordinary lets reorg/CSE erase
it. Use this only when target stack offsets and the 32-bit PSX ABI prove a private
spill slot.

An equal-arm CFG join can likewise retain a target reload without emitting a final
branch. Assign the same already-initialized pointer in both arms between a guard
load and the loop's first load. cse sees separate predecessor identities and keeps
the second load; jump2 later removes the duplicate arms. `AddEnemy` uses this to
preserve the weapon sentinel reload and its load-hazard `nop`. Scope the join to a
defined condition and identical pure assignments—duplicating volatile reads or
effectful expressions would change semantics.

- **A shared return variable copy-preferences its sources together — use early
  returns to split their live ranges.** Funnelling two values through one
  `ret` (e.g. `ret = existing_id; … ret = new_index; return ret;`) makes cc1's
  local-alloc give the short-lived one a copy-preference toward the other's hard
  register: if `new_index` is callee-saved (live across a call), `existing_id`
  gets pulled into that same `$sN` — even though *its own* live range never
  crosses a call. Writing `if (cond) return existing_id; … return new_index;`
  keeps their ranges disjoint, so `existing_id` takes a caller-saved reg like the
  target. This single change turned InsertConflict from a "mutually exclusive
  from C" 26-byte tie into a MATCH; `tools/regalloc.py` had named the
  `$s0 -> $v0` return copy-chain that pinned it. (When a value is in `$sN` but
  its C live range doesn't obviously cross a call, suspect a return/temp
  copy-chain dragging it there — regalloc.py shows the chain.)
  - **The inverse lever is one shared result pseudo when the target preserves an
    early narrow result across unrelated arithmetic.** In `Think3chase`, a
    block-local `u16 result; ... return result;` plus the final direct callback
    return made reload rescue/truncate the early value before the
    `AttackActionCount` update on two predecessors. Hoisting `result`, changing
    the early return to a forward `goto`, assigning the callback result, and
    returning once kept the early value in `$a0`, left the update in `$v0/$v1`,
    and emitted one shared `sll/sra` conversion. That removed two instructions:
    the old exact-length diagnostic was really a duplicated return-conversion
    lifetime, not an arithmetic mismatch. Guided `shared-result-return`
    mechanically tries this only for exactly two returns, one plain unaddressed
    integer local, a final direct return, and equal local/function widths; it
    rejects scope capture, qualifiers, initializers, pointers, and shadowing.
    Replay of the guarded draft improved `(1008 bytes, 18 aligned lines, +2
    instructions)` directly to exact. Use the split form when the return copy
    chain is the problem; use the funnel when one long-lived return identity is
    what the target demonstrates.
  - **The same split fixes a *flag* return (constant 0/1); the failure shape is
    "default then override".** `ret = 0; if (cond) { …; ret = 1; } return ret;`
    puts `ret`'s default assignment *before* the condition test, so its pseudo
    is live simultaneously with the test's own `$v0` temp (regalloc.py shows an
    explicit conflict edge to hard reg `$v0`) — cc1 evicts `ret` to `$v1` and
    emits a trailing `move $v0,$v1`. Two early returns
    (`if (cond) { …; return 1; } return 0;`) let cc1 target `$v0` directly for
    each constant — 0 bytes (DrawBG). When a flag-return draft is one register
    off, try both shapes. The default `autorules` rule `flag-return-split`
    now performs the guarded default/override-to-literal-return direction even
    when useful statements follow the override. In FUN_8005adbc this reduced
    a replay of the shared-result form from 27 whole-image differing bytes to
    an exact 0-byte, 240/240 pure-C match; no permuter run was needed.
- **Source statement order is the main regalloc lever.** Storing
  register-held values first (`prm.type = ty; prm.user = own;`) before
  memory-chain stores frees their registers for later constants — in
  ProcItemKusuri that one swap released `$s0` for the division magic and
  collapsed a whole extra callee-saved register out of the prologue. It also
  decides the final call delay-slot candidate: Think1target's independent
  target-pointer store had to precede its Attrib update, moving the `sw` out of
  `SetNowMotion`'s delay slot and leaving `li $a2,1` there (24→0 bytes).
- **A chained assignment is a reverse-store and shared-constant lever.** C
  evaluates `a = b = c = K` right-to-left, so distinct fields store in
  `c,b,a` order and share the assignment-value lifetime; three standalone
  statements naturally store forward. SetupBG required chains for RGB,
  scale-x/scale-y, and cell-width/cell-height to reproduce retail scheduling.
  `assignment-chain` now mechanically merges two-to-four adjacent same-literal
  stores to distinct fields of one nonvolatile local aggregate, and splits an
  existing chain into forward/reverse explicit orders.
- **Capture an overwritten field inside the new value's RHS when RTL wants the
  independent arithmetic before the old-field load.** The conventional
  `saved = p->u; p->u = saved + expr;` makes the capture a separate producer;
  `p->u = expr + (saved = p->u);` puts it in the store's dependency tree and
  lets old cc1 build/schedule `expr` first while preserving the old `u` for a
  later restore. StageEndScreen needed this shape in every decimal-rendering
  loop. Guided `field-capture-rhs` tries both fused addend orders and both
  conventional split orders, but only for adjacent statements, one exact
  field path rooted in a proven nonvolatile automatic object/parameter, an
  automatic saved local, and an other operand containing only proven automatic
  scalar/member reads (no calls, updates, assignments, raw dereferences, or
  subscripts). It also parses private helper-macro bodies used only by the
  target function, mapping captured names only from those safe outer objects
  and rejecting macro formals. Do not use the shape to move volatile reads or
  effectful work: C does not specify the evaluation order of `+` operands.
- **A comparison literal can be named before an earlier guard so its `li`
  fills that guard's delay slot.** If the target materializes a constant before
  the comparison that logically owns it, assign a local before the preceding
  zero/null guard and use that local in the later comparison. Its mode still
  matters: ProcItemArrow's aim bound had to be `s16`, not `s32`; `type-width`
  found the narrow form that removed the final `$v0/$v1` tie. Do this only when
  the local is live on every path reaching the comparison—the early placement
  is a scheduling/lifetime claim, not cosmetic hoisting.
- **A three-instruction load/literal/equality reversal is a bounded
  commutative tie.** When target and candidate are identical except
  `load $v0; li $v1,K; bne $v0,$v1` versus
  `load $v1; li $v0,K; bne $v1,$v0`, try `K != value` versus `value != K`
  once (`eq-literal-swap`). If the score is flat, the logical comparison and
  branch shape are already right; do not widen into unrelated permutations.
  ActJUMP stayed at its final 3-byte residual under both forms (and swapping
  inequality arms worsened it), so `rtlguide` now names this exact pattern
  `commutative-equality-register-order` as an early-stop signature.
- **A same-address store must go through whichever pointer variable holds the
  base register the asm uses** (`it->param` vs a `pp` alias, even when
  numerically identical): value unaffected, but it decides a delay-slot
  scheduling tie — the wrong one leaves a small pure-reorder residual (Launch:
  9 bytes, `pp+0x28` → `it->param+0x28`).
- For a guarded indirect call, null-check through a variable but **call
  through the field**: `ppu = item->proc; if (ppu == 0) return; ...
  item->proc(item);` — cse reuses the loaded value and allocation lands in
  `$v0`; calling through `ppu` flips it to `$v1`.
- **A cross-predecessor indirect cleanup can need one function-scope callee
  pointer.** Assign `call_item = item->proc` separately on every predecessor
  that reaches the shared cleanup, then null-check/call through that pointer at
  the join. This gives `jalr` one merged incoming pseudo without forcing a
  fresh field reload at the label; predecessor-local pointers or a direct
  field call produce different copy/hazard shapes (ProcItemJirai). This is the
  complement of the duplicated-cleanup rule below: follow the target's actual
  join placement before choosing one.
- Cached pointers that live in `$s`-registers across calls
  (`p = &item->param;`) are real source temporaries — indexing the base
  struct directly doesn't allocate the register (see ProcItemManebue).
- **A call result used as an array index can require naming the array base
  before the call.** `base = Global; r = GetResult(); use(base[r]);` makes the
  address live across the call, where direct `Global[r]` materializes it only
  afterward. In ProcMiscPitfall, the direct `ConflictObject[r]` form produced
  218 instructions; a block-local `ConflictObjectType *conflict` assigned
  before `GetConflictResult` restored the target's 217-instruction length.
  Keep the declaration at the start of the path-specific block so it remains
  valid for the original compiler dialect and does not extend the base across
  unrelated paths. Guided `autorules` mechanizes this immediate
  call/consumer shape as `ptr-base-split`.
- **Initialize a pointer alias at its first path-specific use, not
  automatically at function entry.** An early `locate = dtL` keeps the alias
  live across unrelated guards and hoists the gp load. Assigning it only in the
  successful conflict-object arm places the load at the target use and can
  keep the alias caller-saved (SwimCheck). Ghidra's entry SSA name is not proof
  of source placement; follow the first machine use and predecessor set.
  A call can be the boundary between two aliases of the same address:
  FUN_80037e0c needed `position_base = &work.pos` before `rand()` and
  `position = position_base` after it. The two names create the target's
  preserved pointer copy; one alias throughout lets cc1 coalesce it away.
- **Separate a scanning cursor from the result captured at loop exit.** Even
  when `found_slot` always receives the current `slot`, assigning it before a
  shared post-loop label creates the target's pool-exit move and lets the scan
  cursor die. Reusing `slot` through the consumer extends its allocno and
  changes the tail colouring (FUN_80037e0c).
- **But a dead pointer chain may need to remain direct.**
  `human->model->rotate.vy += K` lets cse overwrite/coalesce the dead `human`
  and model intermediates into the target register. Naming
  `Model *model = human->model; model->...` creates a distinct allocno and can
  rotate the caller-saved registers even though the load/store addresses are
  identical (ProcItemKaengeki). Cache a pointer only when the target keeps it
  live or reuses it; direct chains are also an allocation lever.
  The useful boundary can be the **enclosing object**, not the final member:
  ProcSightShot needed `ModelArchiveType *model = owner->model;` and then
  `&model->rotate`. Precomputing `SVECTOR *model_rot = &model->rotate` created
  a second address pseudo, changed the owner→model chain from `$a1` to
  `$v1/$v0`, and inserted one hazard `nop`. When `rtlguide` points at a
  pointer-chain CSE knot, name each possible prefix boundary separately; do
  not assume the deepest pointer is the best cache.
- **A pool-search cursor and its post-`found:` continuation can be a SEPARATE
  pseudo that's invisible under low register pressure.** Write the loop cursor
  as `cur = items + COUNTER…;`, then `it = cur;` assigned exactly twice — in
  the early-exit (`if (cur->proc == 0) { it = cur; goto found; }`) and once
  before the dispose tail. In SHORT functions `cur`/`it` get the same hard reg
  → the transfer is a deleted self-move; under higher pressure (an `st`/SVECTOR
  local surviving to a late call) they get different regs → a real `move` on
  EVERY edge into the label (cross-jump can't merge — continuations differ).
  Tell: exactly 8 bytes short at the loop-exit label, otherwise identical to
  the single-`it` version. Harmless when unneeded (Ningyo matched with one
  `it`), so try it first when a pool-search function comes up short
  (Makibishi/LightningBolt needed it).
- **Spilled u16 locals loaded several insns before their use went through
  int temps**: `int t1 = cap, t2 = taken; … av = t1 - t2;` — the u16→int
  reads are real zero_extend insns that reload turns into lhu in place;
  combine can't merge them into the later subu. u16 temps DO merge back
  (loads collapse to the use and cost a hazard nop).
- **A surviving `andi rN,reg,0xff` feeding a sum and a later sb across a
  call is `int c = (u8)var;` with var MULTI-DEF** — combine folds the zext
  only over a single-lbu def; reuse another block's variable as the host to
  keep the andi and pin the register (BIS's u0 hosted in the grid x).
- **A loop-internal skip branch whose delay slot duplicates the loop
  increment needs a real `for`**: the rotated exit test leaves
  NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP at the bottom; reorg predicts the branch taken and
  fills from the taken thread (duplicate + retarget). goto/do-while forms
  fill from fallthrough — one insn short (BIS's grid loop).
- **The do{}while(0) lever NESTS and is statement-granular**: each level
  adds +1 loop_depth to flow.c's ref weighting for just the wrapped
  statements. A DOUBLE wrapper flipped a case body's {v0,v1}
  constant/reload pairing; single wrappers around each
  `t = scale ± 0x10; scale = t;` pair made (s16)t read the addiu temp's
  register in all three bounce arms (BIS).
- **A byte-neutral cse re-read works in a COMPARE too**:
  `mx < cq->stock[n]` for `mx < c` folds back to c's register but donates
  different global-alloc preferences (set_preference takes the FIRST operand
  of a compound SET_SRC; find_reg avoids regs other allocnos prefer) —
  flipped one clamp copy's addu tie while the textually identical sibling
  kept the fresh-reg shape (BIS).
- **Which operand goes through the named int temp picks the reload reg**
  (spilled-u16 pairs): temps for both operands let local-alloc hand the
  second zero_extend a low scratch; reading the second operand INLINE
  (`t1 = cap; av = t1 - taken;`) makes its zext an expression temp that
  reload materializes in source order into the next spill reg (BIS digit
  entry).
- **A one-block register tie can hinge on an UNRELATED statement's
  position**: local-alloc's tie-breaking sees the whole block's statement
  order, not just the tied pseudos' positions — when a stubborn swap resists
  every change to the statements touching the swapped registers, move a
  nearby independent assignment instead (PlayerOption: sliding a global
  store two statements later fixed an $a0/$a1 swap whose first uses were
  earlier).
- **An in-place short-lived carrier can add the missing sched1 dependency
  without adding an instruction.**  After a call, the direct spelling
  `sound = CVAnow->param; CVAnow++;` let cc1 represent the cursor and its
  incremented result as separate pseudos.  Sched1 moved the add/store before
  the field load, so both pseudos overlapped; local-alloc gave the cursor
  `$v1` and the result `$v0`, and sched2 preserved the wrong order.  Spelling
  the same work as `cursor = CVAnow; sound = cursor->param; cursor++;
  CVAnow = cursor;` makes the add redefine the carrier, so it cannot cross the
  earlier field read and the cursor/result coalesce in `$v0`.  CVAsequence's
  final 28-byte residual then vanished.  Use a fresh local for the carrier:
  reusing its long-lived scan pointer instead promoted the value to global
  allocation in `$a0`.  Confirm this shape across `.rtl`, `.sched`, `.lreg`,
  and `.sched2`; statement order alone cannot express the missing dependency.
- **A mutable global may need direct reads in each switch arm, yet a separate
  read after its update at the shared tail.**  In CVAupdate, keeping an `event`
  alias alive through several arms created persistent pointer allocnos; reading
  `CVAnow->field` directly removed them.  At the tail, however,
  `cursor = CVAnow + 1; CVAnow = cursor;` coalesced away a target move, while
  `CVAnow++; cursor = CVAnow;` preserved it.  Together with checking the actual
  `GsRVIEW2` offsets (`vrx/vry/vrz`, not `vpx/vpy/vpz`), these changes moved the
  guarded draft from wrong-length 2096/524 to exact-length 2104/526 with only
  allocator residue.  Alias lifetime and field-offset semantics are independent
  checks; use both before trying allocation-only donors.
- **`*p = x = expr;` vs `x = expr; *p = x;` flips a scheduling tie** between
  the load feeding expr and the load computing p's address — try the
  chained-assignment fold when two independent insns land swapped and
  nothing else differs (PlayerOption).
- **Read the permuter's non-winning output dirs**: with --stop-on-zero, every
  improvement leaves an output-<score>-<n>/source.c; a plateaued run's best
  candidate can contain the exact single-statement reorder needed — diff it
  against your base instead of waiting out the random search (PlayerOption
  found its fix in an output-30 dir of a run stuck at 805).
- **Rank those directories by the linked executable, never by the directory
  number.** `tools/permute.py` automatically recompiles each retained `source.c`,
  substitutes its object into a private copy of splat's linker script, resolves
  gp/branch/rodata relocations at the retail addresses, and reports
  `whole image / function window / .text size`. It does not touch the source or
  Shake object tree. Use `tools/permute.py <Name> --rescore-only` after Ctrl-C or
  an external timeout. `ControlHumanoid` proved why: proxy output-525 was the
  real 57-byte winner, while several numerically lower proxy candidates were
  68 bytes away or the wrong length and therefore hundreds of thousands of
  whole-image bytes worse.
- **A late reuse of an existing pointer local can recolor an early block at
  zero byte cost**: global.c allocates one pseudo for the variable across the
  whole function, so assigning a far-later same-kind pointer to it changes its
  refs/lifetime/preferences even when the late block emits the same instructions.
  SetupAppearance's 1024-byte draft was otherwise exact but swapped `$a0`/`$v1`
  in six early instructions; reusing its HumanData pointer temp for the final
  `StageMotion` null-check/free made the whole function MATCH. The permuter found
  this as a nonzero `output-25` candidate; bisecting that one edit against raw
  matchdiff proved it was the load-bearing change.
- **The inverse lever is to stop a late block from redefining an existing
  pointer local.** `p = Global; ... p = Global; p->x ...` makes `p` one
  multi-definition global allocno even when both assignments load the same
  address. If the late region has no mutating calls or writes to the global pointer,
  use `Global->x` directly there: CSE still emits one load for that block, but
  the named `p` remains single-definition and its earlier coloring can change.
  ActJUMP's final three-byte `motID == 0x906` `$v0/$v1` tie was fixed solely by
  dropping a far-later `velocity = dtV` and spelling four air-steering fields
  through `dtV`; the 1,396-byte function then matched exactly. Autorules rule
  `late-pointer-direct` now enumerates this bounded, mutation-free form.
- **Several byte-neutral late reuses can anchor an entire caller-saved
  coloring**: when RTL dumps show that a short-lived block local is being
  claimed by local-alloc, promote the affected same-mode values to
  function-scope locals and reuse each in a distant block whose target hard
  register is already known. ReqItemUse reused three SImode locals in its
  kaginawa case for the items base (`$a1`), `ProcKaginawa` address (`$v0`),
  and scaled item index (`$v1`). Those statements emit the same instructions
  as the natural kaginawa spelling, but make all three pseudos globally
  allocated; reusing two for the earlier lightningbolt sums fixed its final
  15-instruction register permutation and matched all 5272 bytes.
- **One local can intentionally span several disjoint semantic roles.** If
  lifetimes do not overlap, old cc1 can keep page offset, line number, and final
  result in one source `int`, preserving one callee-saved home across all three
  regions. FUN_8005b17c reused `n` this way to keep every lifetime in `$s3`; a
  final `(short)n` supplied the retail return extension. Separate descriptive
  locals changed allocation even though their live ranges did not overlap.
- **Mutually exclusive switch arms can need one shared source local to move a
  value from local-alloc to global-alloc.**  ProcMiscPitfall's two block-local
  `short w` declarations made the resume value pseudo local to one basic block;
  local-alloc claimed `$s0` for it before global allocation ran.  The hoisted
  literal `2` then had a hard `$s0` conflict and fell to `$s3`, leaving six
  otherwise-identical operands.  One function-scope `w`, assigned separately
  in the resume and draw arms, became a global allocno and reused the disjoint
  `$s1` home of parameter `m`; the literal was then free to take `$s0`, matching
  all 868 bytes.  When a low-priority global allocno cannot take the target
  register, inspect `.lreg` for a block-local value that preclaimed it before
  adding one-shot priority weight: sharing the source identity across disjoint
  arms can remove the hard conflict that no global-priority boost can outrank.
- **Byte-neutral respellings are permuter seed levers**: re-reading a cached
  field that cse folds back (`dsp->u = dsp->u + …` for `x + …`) or a
  do{}while(0) around an UNRELATED block shifts pseudo bookkeeping enough to
  flip global-alloc ordering ties (flipped a 40-line callee-saved mirror at
  zero byte cost). Semantic-diff permuter winners against the REPRINTED base
  — the reprint alone skews scores.
- **Anti-rules**: element-pointer temps materialize the array displacement
  as a real addiu (keep repeated `base[n]` spellings); address-taken locals
  move from spill slots to frame slots and shift everything; unreferenced
  static inline helpers still get emitted in stub TUs — keep helpers inside
  the caller's #if guard.
- **Callee-saved homes on short-lived block locals mean VARIABLE REUSE**:
  the original reuses one s16 `j` across the entry-counts loop, the case-1/3
  loops, the grid counter, the shown-items counter, the cursor-move dx and
  the epilogue loop (calls inside two of them force the shared pseudo into
  $s0 everywhere), and reuses `shown` as the cursor-move dy. Distinct
  same-shaped counters stay caller-saved. Also: `for (j = shown; ...)` right
  after `shown = 0;` reproduces a `move` loop-init from the zeroed variable
  (cse copy-propagates, like `i = 0` after `cursor = 0` giving
  `move a0,s8`). Anti-rule: DEAD early assignments cannot steer allocation —
  cse propagates the constant into unrelated code.
- **cse has a (set REG0 REG1) copy-swap special case for ADJACENT pairs**:
  `base = misc; p = base;` back-to-back gets rewritten so the la lands in
  the copy's dest and the copy flips. Keep other initializer insns BETWEEN
  the la and the copy (decl order!) — prev_nonnote_insn adjacency is what
  the swap checks (AddMisc).
- **A stack parameter used exactly once is load-sunk to its use**
  (update_equiv_regs: REG_N_REFS==2 + REG_EQUIV from assign_parms). A local
  copy (`s32 va = ry;`) defeats it — the parm substitutes into the copy, so
  the entry lw lands at the copy's DECL position (decl order = load order)
  and the copy's pseudo needs a hard reg. Every REG_EQUIV-noted parm also
  gets REG_LIVE_LENGTH×2 — raw parms lose allocation races their ref counts
  say they should win (AddMisc).
  - **For a genuinely single downstream use, qualify the parameter OBJECT
    and copy it once.** An ordinary `saved = mode; ... use(saved);` can be
    copy-propagated back into the late use, so the stack load still sinks. In
    `f(..., volatile int mode) { int saved; saved = mode; ... use(saved); }`,
    the observable parameter read cannot move or disappear, while `saved`
    remains ordinary and lives across calls in one register. Top-level
    parameter qualifiers do not change the function type or ABI. This gave
    `CdaPlayXA` its sole early `lw s0,stack(sp)` and exact s0-s6 allocation.
    A volatile cast only at the copy is different: cc1 preserves that early
    read but can still re-read the original parameter later, yielding two
    loads. Qualify the parameter object only when the target proves exactly
    one early access.
- **Loop notes are scheduler barriers** (sched adds artificial deps at
  LOOP_BEG/END): the FIRST real insn after `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END` receives a full
  pending-register/pending-memory dependency (`reg_pending_sets_all`), so moving
  one source statement across an existing one-shot loop boundary can reverse
  apparently independent loads. `autorules`' guided `loop-boundary-shift`
  mechanically tries `do { A; } while (0); B;` ->
  `do { A; B; } while (0);`. More generally, a do{}while(0) weight lever must ENCLOSE any insn that has
  to float across it, and must extend past a switch's tail if a case arm
  jumps out of the note range — otherwise jump.c moves that arm's block to
  the function end (AddMisc).
  The barrier can also preserve a target `nop`: in SetLightningI, naked
  `priority = depth >> 18` moved the `sra` into the preceding positive-depth
  guard's delay slot, making the function one instruction short. Fencing only
  that assignment with `do { ... } while (0)` kept the guard delay slot empty
  and the shift after the following loads, recovering the exact function
  length and cutting the residual from 229 to 155 bytes. This is a sched-order
  lever as well as a copy-propagation/regalloc lever; guided `loop-fence`
  already enumerates expression statements for this shape.
  Later SetLightningI checkpoints also proved that the raw shifted value and
  its clamped call argument need separate source identities: an explicit
  `raw_priority` plus default-first clamp/gotos reduced the then-current
  residual from 150 to 130 bytes without changing the target's CFG. An
  identical-arm fence around the initial `z` load reduced it again to 124
  bytes. jump2 erases both arms into one load, so the final CFG and instruction
  count stay exact; the temporary pre-jump lifetime only changes scheduling
  and allocation. The next material step combined that lever with single-use
  aliases for the initial `RotTransPers` arguments, a shared `ViewInfo` base,
  and bounded one-shot weights on its initial loads. At the other end of the
  function, one loop-note region containing `x0`, `y0`, the raw depth shift,
  `x1`, and `y1` in that source order made the complete priority/clamp/sort
  tail exact. Together these pure-C changes reduced the exact linked residual
  from 124 to 65 bytes while preserving the 334-instruction extent and CFG.
  Treat identical-arm and one-shot constructs as bounded allocation/scheduler
  levers and verify the optimized CFG, not merely the C syntax.
- **An identical-arm pointer alias can decouple a long-lived destination base
  without enclosing the source pointers that feed its initial copies.**
  SetupFly's old inline initializer gave `pfly` enough allocation weight, but
  it also coalesced `start`/`end` into the later call's a0/a1 too early and left
  an extra load-use nop. Assigning `fly = pfly` in both arms of a disposable
  condition, then spelling the six vector copies directly, lets jump2 erase
  the condition while the earlier CFG keeps `fly` as its own source identity.
  The input pointers stay in a1/a2 until their late call-argument moves, and
  the destination base takes retail's s2.

  The exact finish required preserving the product/result identities visible
  in the remaining hard registers. A separate `x_product` gives the first
  `mflo` its caller-saved a3 lifetime before scaled `yw` returns to s3. The
  distance local `len` is then safely reused for the Y product and for the
  final X and Y branch results, reproducing a0 at all three disjoint sites.
  Keep `y_range = yh - half` separate from scaled `yh`: mutating `yh` made the
  range occupy the magnitude's register, while the split gives retail's s0
  range and s5 magnitude simultaneously. Finally, assign the complete X/Z
  coordinate in both jitter arms (and return the complete Y coordinate from
  the inline helper); this prevents cross-jump from merging the arithmetic
  tails into the opposite physical layout.

  Two nested one-shot loops around both the X midpoint and its range assignment
  provide the last allocation weight with no output branch. Keeping the range
  shift inside the same loop-note window also lets sched place it between the
  two midpoint loads instead of preserving a stray nop. Together these source
  identities reduced SetupFly's exact-length checkpoint from 204 linked bytes
  to a 664-byte pure-C exact match. Keep width experiments subordinate to
  proven data types: an autorules `s16` midpoint scored well but was invalid
  because both VECTOR inputs and the midpoint arithmetic are full-width.
- **A retained base and an advancing walker may need distinct source identities
  even when both begin at the same array.** In BreedLife, keeping `base =
  HumanData` beside `search = base`, then spelling the current-row load at the
  top and the next-row sentinel as the loop condition, stopped cc1 from
  rematerializing the table after the search. It also recovered the target's
  load/branch cadence and reduced the exact linked residual from 305 to 282
  bytes. Reusing only the walker loses the original base; indexing the global
  again hides that loss behind a later `lui`/`addiu` pair.
- **If a target-shaped CFG is one instruction too long, use only an initialized,
  already-valid value as a bounded extent donor.** BreedLife's explicit
  high/low tail recovered the target's 15 conditional branches and two jumps,
  while a separately captured high attribute let sched fold two instructions.
  A single volatile read of the already-written `human->point[0]` field restored
  the exact 628-byte extent after the direct map argument removed its stale
  saved-register move, cutting the authoritative residual to 214 bytes and
  raising fuzzy to 84.08. Taking the address of a stack parameter instead was
  not equivalent codegen: it forced an eager entry load and added two
  instructions. Restrict this lever to initialized storage, inspect the whole
  object for address-taken fallout, and keep `matchdiff` authoritative.
- **Global-alloc priority is floor_log2(n_refs)·n_refs/live_length·10000·size,
  ties by pseudo number** (global.c allocno_compare; flow adds loop_depth
  per ref). cc1's `-da` dump prints each pseudo's refs/length and the
  allocation order — with it, the whole caller-saved assignment can be
  ENGINEERED by placing do{}while(0) levers at computed depths (AddMisc:
  body wrapper depth 2 + nested double wrapper on the loop-bottom increment
  gave [a0,a2,a3,t0,t1] exactly).
  Refinements (AdtSelect): read refs/length from `-dl`, the final assignment
  from `-dg`'s "N in HardReg" table; do{}while(0) notes do NOT count toward
  live_length, so boosts compute exactly. floor_log2 makes priority jump
  DISCONTINUOUSLY at 16/32 weighted refs — +1 occurrence can be the right
  boost where +2 overshoots. Wrap a loop with its init HOISTED OUT
  (`i = first; do { for (; i < last; i++) … } while (0);`) to boost interior
  pseudos without boosting the init-read. Hazards: loop notes are sched1
  barriers (never place one between two defs that must interleave), and a
  wrapper around defs WITHOUT their consumer lets cse re-canonicalize +
  combine collapse the copy — the function changes length. Wrap
  def+consumer as a unit or not at all.
  `tools/regalloc.py <Name>` now reads both `.lreg` and `.greg`, prints only the
  real allocnos with their computed priority, and can quantify a proposed
  reweighting: `--compare FIRST SECOND` reports the exact additional weighted
  refs needed; `--enclosed-refs N` converts that delta into wrapper depths when
  one proposed fence encloses N uses. `--between SUBJECT LOWER UPPER` handles
  the harder three-way case: it reports the exact weighted-ref interval and
  wrapper-depth interval that keeps SUBJECT above LOWER but below UPPER. The
  comparison assumes equal register
  mode/size—use the dump, not the number alone, for mixed-mode pseudos.
- **Disjoint semantic phases may need separate block-scoped locals even when
  their arithmetic names repeat.** Reusing one function-scope `dx/dy/dz` set
  for an early distance calculation and a late rotation calculation lets cse
  and local/global allocation coalesce unrelated lifetimes into one broad
  register cycle. Separate nested scopes give gcc distinct pseudos without
  changing runtime code. In SetWire this removed the false distance/final-
  rotation cycle and cut the residual from 418 to 376 bytes; confirm distinct
  pseudos in `.lreg`, since merely renaming overlapping live values does not
  help. A repeated name in PSX.SYM is stronger evidence: each row is a separate
  source declaration, not one variable reported twice. AttackControl records an
  early and a late `enemy`; merging them into one function-scope pointer carried
  the early saved-register identity into the final retarget block, while two
  nested declarations let the late call result remain directly in `$v0` and
  removed the extra move. `matcher-prompt.py` now detects repeated debug-local
  names and emits an explicit scope-identity hint with their demo register homes.
- **Sometimes the target is a priority WINDOW, not an outrank relation.** In
  ProcItemNingyo, the saved-register order required
  `param=4901 < item=4964 < bounce=5000`; +2 weighted refs left `item` too low
  and +4 overshot the upper peer, while exactly +3 landed in the only useful
  interval. An outer wrapper around the null-check/store/indirect-call plus
  three inner null-check weights produced 70 refs / 846 live insns = 4964 and
  the target `$s3/$s4/$s5` window. Use `regalloc.py --between`, then distribute
  the computed depth across the smallest producer/consumer ranges whose loop
  notes also preserve scheduling—do not blindly nest the whole function.
- **Huge-frame TUs (offsets past ±32767) spill params to their arg-home
  slots** once the callee-saved file is full; every use rematerializes
  li/addu/lw through reload's spill regs (a3/t0 rotation). Pointer-VALUE
  reads share one reg in place; pointer-DEREF reads emit a two-reg
  operand-address pair. A residual a3/t0 swap there is RELOAD structure
  (find_reloads_address + allocate_reload_reg rotation), not regalloc —
  permuter-immune; steer it by changing which earlier insns in the same
  block need reloads (AdtSelect's CURRENT(9)).
- **A `do { ... } while (0);` wrapper is a regalloc lever**: the degenerate
  loop generates no code, but its loop notes make flow.c count every ref
  inside at loop_depth 2, doubling those pseudos' priority in global-alloc.
  When the callee-saved assignment is permuted relative to the target and
  statement-level tweaks can't fix it, wrapping the body (after parameter
  setup, before the final return) re-weights the whole interior at once
  (GetAreaMapLevel: flipped four s-registers in one move; GetRealPad's old
  wrapper was the same mechanism).
  The same applies to a **macro's outer `do/while(0)` safety wrapper**: it is
  still a real loop-note range after preprocessing, even when the macro body
  already contains the only runtime loop. In StageEndScreen, changing the
  private decimal-drawing macros' outer wrapper to a plain compound block
  removed accidental weight and scheduler barriers across every expansion.
  Compare preprocessed RTL before adding nested fences to compensate for a
  wrapper the likely original macro never had. Only make this substitution
  when every invocation is a standalone statement and the body has no
  `break`/`continue` whose target would change.
  Loop depth at an **inline call site** also propagates through that specific
  expanded helper body. vmemoryGC first replaced two textual vfree copies with
  one static inline helper, restoring the helper-formal/local identities and
  reducing its exact-length residual 241→96. Three nested zero-trip wrappers
  around only the first call then provided a useful provisional 96→54 result,
  but later source-identity evidence made that broad weighting unnecessary:
  PSX.SYM's one `$s1` `vmpt` is both the early allocation result and the final
  split-tail pointer, while its one `$a3` `svhp` can be reused for the post-call
  neighbour. Those two disjoint-range reuses plus a single narrow wrapper around
  only the helper's header assignment reached an exact-length 12-byte residual.
  Revisit broad call-site fences after a source-variable merge; the old weights
  can become the cause of the next allocation cycle. Require repeated-inline
  source evidence (vmemoryGC had repeated debug-local names), inspect both
  expanded `.greg` ranges, and verify exact extent after each depth.
- **A whole-block `if (X) {block} else {block}` with BYTE-IDENTICAL arms is a
  scheduling lever** (permuter-found; no statement reorder reaches it).
  Duplicating an interleaved multi-load sequence into both arms shifts cc1's
  front-end basic-block/pseudo numbering enough to fix a load-delay-slot
  interleaving order; the straight-line form was 8 bytes longer with a stray
  `nop` and a different colour for an unrelated variable (Think1trace).
  Use an INITIALISED discriminator (`s32 donor = 0`), never an indeterminate
  read: old cc1 still builds the useful CFG before jump2 merges the arms, while
  the dead initialisation costs no code (ProcItemNemuri).
  When a loop fence fixes scheduling but rotates registers by weighting the
  enclosed loads, prefer an already-initialised live local as the discriminator:
  `if (id) y = p->y; else y = p->y;`. DefaultActionHumanoid used this exact
  zero-code CFG fence after nested LOOP_ENDs; it retained the target `$a1/$a2`
  allocation where wrapping `y` in a third one-shot loop swapped them.
  Guided `identical-arm-fence` enumerates only nonvolatile locals already used
  by the statement or unconditionally defined in the preceding statements.
  A second use is to break a **hard conflict caused by a stack-address
  pseudo**: ProcItemNingyo's address of its memset/request workspace occupied
  `$s3` across calls, preventing `item` from taking the target `$s3`. Duplicating
  the address-producing statement into identical arms made that pseudo cross a
  CFG edge differently and removed the conflict with no surviving branch.
  Confirm this in `.greg`'s conflict set before adding the fence; the visible
  C pointer name alone does not reveal the stack-address allocno.
  The same function may need several eliminated fences for **different pass
  facts**, so do not replace them with one blanket wrapper. Think3escape uses
  three: one duplicate result assignment raises allocation weight enough for
  `$a0`; one duplicate `abs_degree2 = degree2` prevents cse from sourcing the
  later negate from the untouched raw value; and one duplicate
  `human = Me_THINK_C` preserves the guarded `$v1`→`$a1` pointer copy. jump2
  erases all three. Guided `identical-arm-fence` already enumerates each local
  site independently; inspect `.cse` and `.greg` between accepted candidates
  instead of assuming every byte-neutral fence is merely a weight donor.
  A related **source-identity split** can preserve both a raw parameter and a
  cached full-width copy when a straight assignment is copy-propagated away:
  `alias = cache = raw; if (initialized_discriminator) raw = alias; else raw =
  alias;`. Consumers of `raw` and `cache` then remain distinct through cse and
  global allocation even though jump2 erases the conditional. At the guarded
  GetAreaMapVector checkpoint this form fixed every persistent saved-register
  assignment while leaving no runtime branch; it did not fix the remaining
  scheduler residual, so treat it as a measured late lever rather than proof
  of original syntax until whole-function bytes match.
  Think3firstattack adds a scheduling-dependency form: duplicating
  `degree = Degree` under `if (masked)` made the mask calculation a predecessor
  dependency, so sched2 could no longer hoist the Degree load or fill the
  target's load/sign-branch delay nops. The exact source also widened the final
  `result` carrier from `s16` to `s32`, deferring its one conversion to the
  shared return tail. Each edit alone made the function two instructions too
  long, while the pair was exact; ordinary exact-length beam pruning therefore
  could not discover it as two sequential states. `identical-arm-fence` now
  emits the bounded atomic pair only for a plain unshadowed function-scope
  16-bit local returned directly by a 16-bit function. Historical replay moved
  the 28-byte exact-length park directly to 0; no permuter was needed.
- **The discriminator of an eliminated identical-arm fence is still allocator
  input.** jump2 removes both the conditional and duplicate body, but global
  allocation has already seen the discriminator's live values. ActSTATE's
  final four-byte residual used identical `D_80097F0E = 1` arms: testing
  `Me_MOTION_C->attribute` kept the humanoid pointer live across
  `motID = 0x501` and forced the literal into `$v1`; testing `dtM->count`
  instead left both pointer and literal in the target `$v0`, with no surviving
  branch or load. Treat the condition as a liveness probe, not cosmetic syntax.
  Guided `identical-arm-condition` now recognizes an existing byte-identical
  if/else fence and tries up to twelve side-effect-free conditions already
  present within 64 source lines. It rejects calls, writes, indexing,
  division/modulo, increment/decrement, and automatic locals that belong to a
  different scope; exact-byte scoring decides which source-authentic probe has
  the needed pre-jump2 conflicts. As with any global-pointer probe, review the
  surrounding state invariant before keeping the winning candidate.
- **A final register swap may need an earlier ALLOCATION DONOR site, not an
  edit at the residual's mapped source line.** In FUN_80033bc0, `pos` had 4
  refs / 252 live insns (priority 317) and lost `$s5` to the EffectSlot base at
  priority 330. Duplicating an earlier conditional store into arms selected by
  `if (pos)` added one temporary RTL reference; jump/cross-jump erased the
  branch and duplicate store, while global allocation saw `pos` at 5 refs / 260
  live insns (priority 384) and assigned the target `pos=$s5/base=$s6`. The
  guided `allocation-donor-fence` rule now takes parameter names directly from
  rtlguide's register substitutions and searches assignments in existing
  conditional arms even when they are away from the final diff line. Replaying
  that rule on the 11-byte baseline tried four bounded `pos` sites and found an
  independent exact fence around the earlier EffectSlot-cursor reset (11→0).
  Absent source-level proof of initialization, restrict this lever to
  nonvolatile parameters: an arbitrary automatic local may be indeterminate at
  the artificial test.
  A donor can also improve jump2/cross-jump layout without changing the final
  hard register. PlayVoice duplicated its fallback-hit `loc = cursor` under an
  initialized `loc` discriminator; the conditional vanished and the function
  stayed exactly 756 bytes, while the authoritative residual fell 190→120 even
  though `loc` remained in `$s1`. Its sequence-based fuzzy score fell
  74.60→73.54 at the same time. Score these probes by exact extent and
  `matchdiff` bytes, not only by the allocator assignment or fuzzy heuristic.
  The later 120→14-byte PlayVoice reconstruction also shows that a repeated
  PSX.SYM local name can be the missing lifetime boundary: two block-scoped
  `min`/`sec` pairs, rather than one function-scoped pair, made the whole
  playback tail exact. For its two table scans, `alias = cache = raw` followed
  by identical `raw = alias` arms kept the current pointer separate from a
  result/peek pointer until jump2. Finally, an explicit backward success label
  let fallback hits share retail's two-instruction trampoline, while moving
  the id reload inside the rotated loop retained the otherwise redundant first
  load. Together those structural changes preserved the exact 756-byte extent
  and reduced the residual to three allocator/scheduler islands. Use symbol
  scope, loop rotation, and shared-label placement before adding more weight to
  a register-only checkpoint.
- **An automatic local already read by an enclosing guard is also a safe
  ALLOCATION DONOR.** Reaching either arm proves the guard value was initialized
  and evaluated, so it can discriminate byte-identical assignments without an
  invented indeterminate read. In Think1target, `distance` narrowly lost the
  global-allocation race to the z coordinate (7692 vs 7714); duplicating the
  guarded absolute-value assignment under `if (distance)` raised it to 8000,
  swapped the two saved-register homes, and reduced the exact-length residual
  from 35 to 24 bytes. Guided `allocation-donor-fence` now searches this bounded
  enclosing-guard case as well as initialized parameters, including donor sites
  away from the residual's mapped line.
- **Remove invented invariant-base locals before donating allocation weight.**
  AddEnemy's explicit `HumanData`, `StageAppearance`, and `WeaponModel` base
  pointers over-constrained three loop-wide lifetimes and left its otherwise
  complete draft five instructions short. Direct global-array expressions
  recovered four instructions. An enclosing guard had already read the stage
  index `j`, so duplicating the following `weapon_entry = WeaponModel`
  assignment under `if (j)` was a defined zero-code donor: jump2 erased the
  fence, global allocation retained the extra weighted reference, the draft
  reached the exact 1152-byte extent, and the linked residual fell to 537
  bytes. Treat the order as diagnostic: first remove unsupported source
  aliases, then use a donor only when the value's initialization is proven.
- **A dead-until-overwrite local can donate a disjoint source identity without
  runtime work.** If uninitialized `later` is untouched before `later = L`, then
  `early = E; use(early); ... later = L` can be written as
  `later = early = E; use(later); ... later = L`. The extra automatic-local
  assignment is unobservable on defined paths, while old cc1 can join the two
  live ranges and inherit the later local's allocation preferences.
  Think1target's x alias moved an exact-length residual from 63 to 38 bytes; the
  corresponding z alias exposed the final 7714/7692 priority tie at 35 bytes.
  Guided `disjoint-local-alias` enumerates only same-type function-scope integer
  locals whose address is never taken, which are not shadowed or loop-carried,
  whose alias is uninitialized and untouched before the site, whose first later
  occurrence is a plain overwrite, and whose substituted read is in the
  current compound block.
- **An identical-arm discriminator can also be a PREFERENCE DONOR.** Declare it
  at function scope, initialise it for the artificial `if`, then overwrite it
  with the real value immediately before a call that wants a particular
  argument register. The branch and initial value disappear, but the one pseudo
  has participated in both CFGs and inherited the later call preference.
  ProcItemNemuri used `s32 bleed_n = 0`, identical arms, then `bleed_n = 2`
  before `SetBleeds`; this changed allocation without leaving a materialised
  zero or branch in the final binary.
- **Measure nested zero-trip-loop weighting instead of guessing its depth.** A
  statement in N nested `do { ... } while (0)` wrappers receives N extra
  loop-depth counts per reference. In ProcItemNemuri, putting the split colour
  construction in three nested wrappers inside BOTH identical arms gave its
  `env` pseudo 9 weighted refs / 49 live insns, priority 5510, above `wave` at
  5 / 35, priority 2857; that produced target `$t0`/`$t1`. A shallower wrapper
  was insufficient. Confirm the exact threshold with
  `tools/regalloc.py <Name> --compare FIRST SECOND --enclosed-refs N`.
  DrawTargetS shows why this can be a multi-value priority WINDOW rather than
  one outrank test. Narrow wrappers around only the small-arm x/y/neary
  expressions produced x=14222, y=14166, neary=10909, priority=7317, and
  nearx=4000, assigning `$s0` through `$s4` in exactly that order. One fewer
  neary wrapper left priority/neary swapped; one more put neary ahead of y.
  Nest only the expressions named by `regalloc.py`, re-run after every depth
  change, and require the optimized disassembly to contain no surviving loop.
- **Keep the small scheduling levers around that weighted identical block.** A
  large literal written as `env = 0x6e0000; env |= 0x6e6e;` exposes separate
  `lui`/`ori` definitions that can straddle the vanished branch. Assigning a
  call temp (`bleed_range = 300`) immediately AFTER a duplicated multi-load
  update lets its hard-register copy fill that update's load delay. And when an
  `lbu` field feeds a multiply, a full-width named temp can schedule the load
  early without the `andi 0xff` that an `u8` temp may introduce. These three
  source shapes were all required by ProcItemNemuri's exact case-2 schedule.
- **A narrow field's first use can need a distinct one-use full-width carrier.**
  `s32 initial_h = sp->h;` lets combine keep the `lhu` as an SI-producing load
  and sched place an independent store between that load and its comparison.
  Reusing the later `u16 h` may leave a load-delay `nop`, while moving that
  narrow carrier earlier can require an extra `andi`. FUN_80056910 used the
  full-width carrier only for its entry guard and retained the proven `u16`
  field/local on the later loop path. Split by use site before changing a
  structure field's correct width.
- **Hoist a shared `result = 0;` default to the function's SINGLE entry, not
  per-branch** — reorg then folds that one store into the very first branch's
  delay slot, shared by every downstream path; writing it separately in each
  branch prevents the fold and forces per-branch reconstruction (Think1trace).
- **Reused parameters vs fresh locals show in the prologue**: `move $s5,$a1`
  + later arithmetic on $s5 means the original overwrote the parameter
  (`x = x / 10;`) — the param pseudo gets a callee-saved home. A fresh local
  computes straight into the s-register with no entry move.
  - **This extends to POINTER parameters, and the per-call offsets are the
    tell** (`LoadOrnament`). `adr = adr + 1; f(adr); g(adr + 2);` — reassigning
    the pointer parameter in place and then using a *smaller residual* offset for
    the second call — reproduces both the callee-saved register reuse and the
    exact offset split. Two fresh computations off the untouched parameter
    (`f(adr + 1); g(adr + 3);`) put the value in a different register and compute
    both offsets fresh: a register swap plus an instruction-shape mismatch.
  - **A nullable pointer reassigned to a stack fallback must continue to be the
    base of fallback initialisation.** Use `center = &local; center->y = ...;
    center->z = ...`, not stores through `local` followed by a later pointer
    assignment, when the target addresses those fields through the pointer's
    hard register. SetWire's target used `$s4` for both fallback stores; those
    two extra references also moved `center` through the exact narrow priority
    window relative to `end` and the loop flag. This is simultaneously an
    addressing fact and a measured regalloc lever—inspect the target store
    bases and `regalloc.py --between` before adopting it.
- **A value computed into a source temp BEFORE an intervening store frees the
  return register for an earlier expression.** In `AfsGetHeader` the target
  builds `maxElements`'s shift/or chain in `$v0`, then `move $v0,zero` (the
  `return 0`) lands *between* the two field stores, so the second chain
  accumulates in `$v1`. Writing the two field assignments in plain source order
  (`a = X; flag = 0; b = Y;`) makes cc1 materialize `$v0 = 0` ahead of the first
  chain, pushing *its* accumulator to `$v1` and re-colouring both — a same-length,
  instruction-for-instruction-identical, 61-byte miss. The fix is a named local:
  `a = X; tmp = Y; flag = 0; b = tmp;`. The tell is loads for the *second*
  expression scheduled before the intervening store, while its own store stays
  after. (Related: N adjacent loads with no use between them are source temps.)
- **A delay-slot instruction can be pulled BACKWARD across calls by reorg** —
  its position in Ghidra/the disassembly ("the statement right before this
  call") is not proof of its source position. When a manually-placed
  increment resists sitting near its apparent slot, try moving it PAST
  subsequent calls (ReqItemHappou's permuter fix moved `j++;` from before
  SearchItemTarget2 to after SetupFly, crossing two calls).
- **A trivial dependency-free constant as the FIRST statement floats its `li`
  above the prologue `sw ra`** (not just above unrelated stores). Writing the
  statement that needs a LOAD first anchors the schedule so `sw ra` stays put
  and the `li` fills the load's delay slot (ReqItemStay).
  - **No-load body (one call, only constant args) → wrap it in `do { … }
    while (0);`.** When there's no load anywhere to anchor on, the loop-note is a
    genuine scheduler barrier that pins `sw ra` before the wrapped body, exactly
    as a load would — fixes the constant-args floating above the prologue
    (EVENT_OBJ_F4/11C's `DeliverEvent(...)` — though those stay NON_MATCHING for
    the separate SDK-compiler reason below).
- **Assignment position around a branch is a double lever** (ReqItemDrop):
  `pp = ...;` placed *before* `if (it == 0) return 0;` lets reorg fill the
  `beqz` delay slot with its `addiu` (instead of collapsing the return-0
  block into the slot) *and* lengthens pp's live range, demoting its
  allocation priority so the function argument keeps `$s1`. One statement
  move fixed a register swap, a missing block, and two missing instructions.
- **An independent load can schedule BEFORE unrelated stores that textually
  precede it — don't reorder source to chase its asm position.** cc1 hides
  load latency by hoisting a load past intervening stores it doesn't alias:
  ReqItemKusuri's `it->locate` reload (fresh per the no-cached-pointer-temp
  rule) appears in the asm before the `it->proc=`/`it->mode=`/`it->type=`
  stores that precede it in source, yet the natural owner/proc/mode/type/coord
  statement order matched first try. A load ahead of "earlier" stores is the
  scheduler, not a source reordering.
- **A table-backed field assignment before a literal field assignment can steer
  the whole surrounding call schedule.** In FUN_8004a6bc,
  `slot->rotate = table[i].rotate; slot->attribute = 0x40000000;` emits the
  target's `lw rotate; li attribute; sw attribute; sw rotate`. Reversing only
  those independent assignments emits `li; sw; lw; sw`; sched also chooses the
  slot-address calculation instead of `i++` for the preceding GetImage delay
  slot. When one load/literal-store pair and an earlier call-delay candidate all
  rotate together, test the two semantically independent field orders as one
  bounded scheduling lever.
- A base-address pseudo appearing mid-sequence (`addiu $a0, $s1, 8` between
  two accesses) is a temp assigned between the statements:
  `t[0] = p->start.vx; st = &p->start; t[1] = st->vy; ...`.
- The reverse also holds: **cc1 does not fold away a pointer temp to a frame
  object**. `PARAM_ITEM_USE *prm = (PARAM_ITEM_USE *)buf;` allocates a
  callee-saved register for the address (frame grows, prologue shifts), and a
  `VECTOR *w = (VECTOR *)(buf + 0x10);` temp inside a loop reshuffles the
  induction/invariant registers. When the target *rematerializes* a frame
  address (`addiu $a0, $sp, 0x10` appearing repeatedly), the original wrote
  the cast at every use — repeated `((T *)buf)->field` casts, however ugly,
  are the source's real shape. `sizeof(T)` in the memsets is free
  (compile-time constant) and matches.

- **A same-width store-to-load can be a byte-neutral scheduling dependency.**
  Sched's equal-priority tiebreak made FileOption's independent mask precede
  its byte store, while the target stored first. Writing
  `STAGE_LAYOUT_NUMBER[0] = k; ... load_layout(STAGE_LAYOUT_NUMBER[0]);`
  made the call argument depend on the store. CSE store-forwarded the byte
  read to the same `andi a0,v1,0xff`, so no reload survived, but sched retained
  the required `sb; andi` order and closed the final six bytes. When the stored
  object already has the consumer's narrow width, try reading it back before
  adding a loop fence; confirm that the optimized assembly contains no load.
- **Anti-rule: sched's equal-priority tiebreak prefers the
  memory-unit insn** — a store and an independent ALU op simultaneously
  ready always emit [alu][store]. A target showing [store][alu] with all
  else matched resisted statement order, temps, multi-def hosts and
  do{}while(0) fences (fences can pin the order but retie a dying operand
  into the call-argument register). Make the pair not simultaneously ready
  through a real source dependency such as the store-forwarded reread above;
  do not keep permuting independent statements.

## Shared tails

**A referenced `case` label is a hard cross-jump fence.** gcc-2.8.1
`jump.c:find_cross_jump` scans backward from two jumps, but immediately gives
up when stream 1 reaches a `CODE_LABEL` (it merely skips labels in stream 2).
If two branches should share their final tail but must retain separate copies
of the check immediately before it, put the exceptional copy behind a real
switch label.  StateTransition uses a boolean `switch` with `case 0` and
`default`: the three independently written Findenemies tails still
cross-jump into one block and carry their already-loaded Humanoid pointer into
the join, while the case-0 post-alert type check stays distinct from case 1.
An ordinary `if`, `do{}while(0)`, or an unreferenced alias label did not stop
that over-merge; the label must survive as an actual branch target.

**Now mechanized (advanced/opt-in):** when `rtlguide` classifies a residual as
`jump/cross-jump`, `autorules --guided` can try the two semantics-preserving
two-way-switch spellings (`case-fence`) at the implicated `if/else` lines. It
rejects arms containing a source `break`, whose meaning would change inside a
switch. Exact-byte scoring decides whether either surviving CODE_LABEL is the
one the target requires.

**Algebraically equal affine multiply tails can be kept distinct without a
control-flow fence.** jump2 compares RTL, so `x * 3 + 480` and
`(x + 160) * 3` compute the same value but do not present the same backward
instruction suffix. In FUN_800519bc, using one spelling in only one brightness
arm prevented an unwanted merge that had erased exactly three instructions and
an unconditional jump; an explicit center label then pinned the retained tail.
Guided rule `mul-affine-shape` now toggles `x*M+C` with `(x+C/M)*M` whenever
the constant is exactly divisible, letting scoring place this bounded
cross-jump barrier mechanically.

**Machine-identical calls can be different to jump2.** Cross-jump compares the
whole `CALL_INSN`, including its result mode and trailing
`CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE`, not only the final `jal` opcode. If the target keeps
more physical calls than the candidate, inspect `.rtl` against `.jump`/`.jump2`
before restructuring the CFG. In ActATTACK, the original caller's old-style
`DeleteConflict` declaration allowed already-live `$a1` values at some sites,
while one typed call expression supplied an HImode result. The five eventual
`jal DeleteConflict` instructions look alike, but those RTL fingerprints stop
jump2 from merging the required sites.

`rtlguide` now detects a target physical-call surplus, names target-only aligned
callees, counts calls through the RTL passes, and prints each candidate call's
result/use fingerprint. Treat that output as a declaration and liveness clue,
not permission to add guessed arguments: m2c frequently mistakes stale argument
registers for source arguments, and changing a shared callee prototype can alter
other translation units. Caller-local old-style declarations or typed call
expressions require case-by-case semantic review, so this diagnosis is not an
automatic rewrite.

**One physical call can originate as duplicated branch-local calls.** Keep the
call written in both arms when the target prepares different arguments in each
predecessor but then has a single tail-merged `jal`. Factoring it into
`arg = ...; f(arg);` creates join-crossing argument pseudos, changes `%hi` ties,
and can reorder loads/delay slots even though jump2 still emits one call. This is
especially visible for narrow parameters and stack-passed arguments: a correct
caller-local prototype controls HImode extension and which setup remains in the
predecessor. DefaultActionHumanoid's call tails and DamageControl's duplicated
MoveHumanoid arms are the worked cases. Inspect call fingerprints through
`.rtl`→`.jump2`; do not infer source factoring from the final call count.

ActSWIM adds the physical-layout version of the same rule. Its two movement
arms both called `MoveHumanoid` and jump2 reduced fourteen expanded source
calls to the target's eleven physical calls, but the two `$a0` producers still
had to remain different: one arm used a block-local `Humanoid *human`, while
the other read the global directly. Once size, call count, and CFG were exact,
the last residual was only the choice of fallthrough arm. Keep the source
calls duplicated and invert which terminal arm is written first; do not factor
the argument or call merely because the final assembly contains one `jal`.

**Now mechanized (guided):** `terminal-arm-flip` recognizes an `if` compound
followed by either another compound or a short plain statement sequence when
both arms end in `return`, or both `goto` the same label. It negates the guard,
swaps the arms, and wraps a plain second arm in a block, preserving block-local
declarations and the terminal CFG. `rtlguide` reports
`terminal-arm-layout-flip` when target and candidate have equal length, equal
physical control-flow counts, and the same instruction multiset except for one
aligned inverse conditional; it then tries this rule before the broader
explicit-`else` inversion. On ActSWIM's 98.93% checkpoint this generated the
exact pure-C branch layout directly; no permuter run was needed.

**A named `goto` label pins cross-jump's choice of primary copy.** When several
unconditional exits share a tail (e.g. every reject does `x = -1; goto ret;`), route them
all through ONE named label placed exactly where the target's copy lives — cross-jump
then merges onto that copy, not whichever it would pick by scan order. Placing the
`reject:` label inside an existing guard where the target keeps it fixed DrawModel's
length (Ghidra's literal `goto unit_vector;` on the box-check failures had sent them to
the wrong tail, changing the merge).

**Assign a sentinel ONLY on each exit edge, never once at the top, to keep it
rematerialised in a caller-saved reg.** `result = -1; goto ret;` per reject keeps
`result`'s live range short, so cc1 leaves it in caller-saved `$v0` and re-emits
`li v0,-1` per site; hoisting `result = -1;` to the top forces ONE `$a2` materialisation
and drops the rematerialisations (one instruction short). And a reject condition that is
textually identical to the shared tail must be a STANDALONE `if`, not the enclosing
guard's `else` — as an `else` body cross-jump merges it away, costing the direct branch
and a recompute (`DrawSprite`, the exact missing instruction).


**An early `return !flag;` right after `flag = 1;` gets constant-folded to a
literal.** `IsVisible` sets a `fail` flag and has exactly ONE `return !fail;`, at the
bottom; making the failing branch return locally lets cc1 fold `!1` to `0` there —
three instructions shorter than the target. Keep a distinct merge label with a
second predecessor when several tests must share one flag assignment:

```c
flag = 0;
if (first_bad)
    goto failed;
if (second_bad)
    goto failed;
goto done;
failed:
flag = 1;
done:
return !flag;
```

The success edge into `done` prevents the failure value from becoming constant at
the return, while both failures still contribute only one `flag = 1` definition.
This distinction closed `IsVisible`'s pure three-register rotation: duplicating the
assignment made `fail` 4 refs / 22 live insns (priority 3636), but the shared block
made it 3 / 20 (1500), below the quotient allocnos at 3333 and 1764, with no emitted
CFG change. A shared assignment followed immediately by its own local return is the
constant-folding anti-pattern; a shared assignment feeding a genuine multi-predecessor
join is an allocation lever.

**When both arms of an if/else end in the same statement on an address-taken
variable, duplicate it into BOTH arms.** Writing it once after the if/else forces a
fresh stack reload at the merge point (the variable is memory-resident because its
address escapes); duplicating lets each arm feed the statement from the register it
already has. cc1's own cross-jump then collapses the identical code, so duplicating
costs nothing and matches the target (`AdtMessageBox`).

**Duplicate a whole cleanup/advance tail when its physical address is inside the
state bodies.** Writing one factored helper block or one post-switch tail pins the
code at that source location. Writing the complete pure-C sequence independently
at each exit lets jump2 cross-jump onto its chosen last copy, including indirect
call/null-check cleanup and `mode++; return;` tails. ProcItemDokudango needed the
cleanup at both disposal origins and the advance tail at three mode exits; the
final binary contains one shared copy at the target's internal address.

**A direct terminal global tail can replace a named value local and preserve
every constant island.** ActENGAGE's target has many blocks shaped like
`li v0,K; j shared_store`, including two separate item cases that both load
`0xf02`. A named `short next_motion` became a `reg/v` pseudo that conflicted
with `$v0` across the intervening comparisons: it allocated to `$a0`, and
jump2 also collapsed the two identical `0xf02` blocks. Write the semantically
complete terminal sequence at each successful edge instead:

```c
motID = 0xf02;
D_80097F0E = 1;
return;
```

Leave the desired last physical edge (ActENGAGE's `motID = 0x602`) as the
fallthrough anchor. Each literal store first gets its own HImode producer;
global allocation puts those short producers in `$v0`, then jump2 merges only
the common `sh motID; li 1; sh D_80097F0E; return` suffix onto the anchor.
Referenced switch labels stop the backward merge before the constant loads, so
even equal case values retain separate `li/j` islands. This is both a
cross-jump lever and a way to avoid an impossible named-local `$v0` allocation.

The same principle fixes late scheduling joins. A shared `D_80097F0E = 1`
after a motion-selection if/switch made ActENGAGE emit `sh zero,motID` before
`li v0,1`; writing that flag assignment in each terminal selection arm let
jump2 retain one D-store while sched2 put the load before the zero store, as in
the target. Guided `shared-tail-assign` now enumerates the narrow adjacent
if/else form: two compound arms followed immediately by one plain assignment.
When the shared suffix is an assignment **and return**, guided
`shared-terminal-tail` also tries both complete terminal arms atomically. It
rejects arm-local declarations so moving the suffix inside the compounds cannot
change identifier binding. ActACTION confirmed the source-shape family:
independent `motID; D_80097F0E = 1; return;` edges let jump2 retain the distinct
motion stores while merging only the flag/return suffix.
Larger switch-wide terminal-tail expansion remains a deliberate CFG rewrite;
verify the final fallthrough anchor in `.jump2` rather than assuming which copy
jump2 will choose.

**The shared-return lever fires only on INDEPENDENTLY-WRITTEN identical returns, not an
explicit goto to one.** Two separately-written identical `return EXPR;` statements let
jump2's cross-jump merge them into ONE shared call site placed EARLY; routing both
through an explicit `goto label;` instead pins that code at the label's own textual
position -- a byte regression. So: write the identical returns out in full, do not
factor them into a goto (`Think4abandon`; the inverse of the cases where a named goto
label is what you want -- see the shared-tails section).

**Two otherwise byte-identical `return expr;` tails can fail to cross-jump-merge in
this cc1.** Route all but one through `goto` to a single shared `return` — in
`CGetLevel`, funnelling three arms into one `ret` variable plus one
`goto done; … done: return ret;` was what merged the epilogues. Related but distinct
from the `li`-suppressing bare-`goto` rule under Dispatch: that one is about the value,
this one is about the tail.


- **A store shared by both branch paths via the branch delay slot**: load the
  condition into a temp first, store between the temp and the branch
  (`uid = StageConfig[...].uid; q->counts[0] = 0xFF; if (uid == 0) {...}`) —
  the constant li fills the load-delay slot and reorg drops the lone `sb`
  into the branch delay slot, executed on both paths. Writing the store
  BEFORE the load lets the scheduler hoist it too early; writing it
  DUPLICATED inside both paths only cross-jumps when both copies' first
  insns are identical including registers
  (BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen's entry).
- **Write each switch case's call INLINE rather than funnelling its arguments
  through one shared local into a single post-switch call.** The funnelled form
  (`case X: s = STR_X; break; … f(s, …);`) forces a two-register hi/lo address
  split — a temp for `%hi`, a different register for the `%lo`-completed pointer.
  Writing `case X: f((T *)STR_X, …); break;` per case instead lets gcc's
  cross-jump pass merge the identical call-tails into ONE physical copy *and*
  lets each address materialize straight into the call's own argument register,
  reproducing the target's single-register `$a0`-to-`$a0` shape (FUN_8004f6c0).
- An identical dispose/cleanup sequence reached from two paths with a `j`
  into the middle of one copy is **the code written out twice** in source —
  GCC's cross-jump pass merges the common suffix (from the `jalr` backwards;
  the differing prefixes, e.g. two different `mode = 0xff` stores, stay
  separate). A shared `goto` label merges *more* than the original (loses the
  duplicated call-site setup) — don't.
  ProcItemNinken sharpens the indirect-call case: in EACH duplicate, cache
  `proc = item->proc` for the null check but call through `item->proc(item)`.
  cse reuses that predecessor-local load and gives the `jalr` the target `$v0`;
  jump2 then cross-jumps the two cleanup suffixes from the `jalr` backward. If
  the call is factored behind one explicit `dispose:` label, that join is a CSE
  boundary and the field spelling reloads `item->proc` plus a hazard `nop`;
  calling the cached variable instead keeps the wrong `$v1`. ProcItemNapalm is
  the matched family precedent. Duplicate the source idiom and let jump2—not a
  hand-written label—recover the shared machine tail.
  LoadSI applies the same rule to ordinary error cleanup: spelling
  `vfree(temp); temp = 0; return 0;` in both error arms prevents cse from
  caching the earlier `&cmd`/`&result` stack addresses across a shared source
  label, while jump2 still merges the duplicate cleanup into one physical
  tail. A factored cleanup was shorter C but produced extra saved pointers.
- **When two branches build the SAME call with all-different arguments, write
  the call literally twice (once per branch), not funnelled through shared
  locals + one post-merge call.** Cross-jump merges only the byte-identical
  suffix (`jal` + empty delay slot); the argument-loading prefix stays
  per-branch — including a same-valued-constant CSE chain (`a0=0` fresh, then
  `a1`/`a2` copied from `a0`) that a single shared call site won't reproduce
  (one branch reads globals, the other passes all-zero — StartDrawing area).

- **Multiple `return CONST;` statements cross-jump unpredictably; a labeled
  return body pins them**: write the constant return once, label INSIDE the
  last guarding if (`if (...) { ret_min: return 0x80000000; }`), `goto
  ret_min;` elsewhere — one fallthrough-entered body whose insns reorg steals
  into the other branches' delay slots.
- A conditional branch that lands PAST a load at its target block is reorg's
  redundant-insn elimination (the branch path already has the value): both
  source paths simply read the same variable — no restructuring needed.
- **A call+return tail shared by several loop exits, with the argument `li`
  in each exit's jump delay slot, is ONE copy written after the loop**:
  `break` from each path and write the call once (PauseProc's
  `SsSetMVol(0x7f,0x7f)`). Reorg steals the after-loop block's first insn
  (the arg li) into each break-jump's empty delay slot and retargets past
  it; a path whose slot is already full keeps jumping to the li itself.
  Duplicating the call per path merges WORSE (sched2 drags the arg setup
  from the call; cross-jump suffixes stop matching).

### A false Ghidra/splat multi-piece split is sometimes just ONE function

When `reverse.py` seeds several `INCLUDE_ASM` lines for one target but
`config/splat.main.exe.yaml` carves it as a SINGLE `c` segment, the extra pieces are
usually consecutive calls (e.g. two `FntPrint`s with different literal-string addresses)
that tricked Ghidra's function-boundary detection. Write one real C function and DELETE
every stub -- do NOT reach for `split-scaffold.py` (that is for genuine jump tables).
The literal-string addresses may need pinning in `config/symbols.<target>.txt` (Camera's
two FntPrint format strings). (`Camera`.)

## Split functions (jump tables through .rodata)

**`tools/split-scaffold.py <Name>` does all of this for you** — run
`tools/reverse.py <Name>` first (adds the `c` carve, generates the pieces),
then `split-scaffold.py <Name>` writes the full NON_MATCHING stub (every
INCLUDE_ASM piece + the jump table(s) as `static const u32 …_jtbl[]`), inserts
the `.rodata` carve, and leaves `./Build check` green; fill in the `#else`
draft and iterate. reverse.py detects the split case and points you at it.

**But not every 2-piece report is a real jump table.** A
`__override__prt_<addr>_<hash>` symbol at a mid-function address makes
reverse.py/split-scaffold see two pieces, yet if the raw `.s` has NO branch to
that address — piece 1 falls straight through into piece 2 — it's ONE ordinary
function: write it as plain C with no `_jtbl` array (SetupStageSequence;
FileOption.c has a buried instance). Check for an actual jump before scaffolding.

The manual mechanics, for reference:

A table-switch splits the function into several nonmatching .s pieces and
routes the table through the C object's .rodata (see the yaml comment at the
BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen carve). Consequences: the yaml needs
`- [fileoff, .rodata, <Name>]` at the table's original address plus a data
re-split line after it; the STUB state
must INCLUDE_ASM all pieces (entry + switchD + every caseD, address order).
Preferred protocol: DELAY the `.rodata` carve until you activate the real
switch — during the stub phase the table stays raw incbin'd data and no
placeholder is needed; add the carve (address from the
`switchD_…__switchdataD_<tableaddr>` symbol) together with the real C, whose
compiled table then supplies the bytes. (A `static const u32 …_jtbl[]`
placeholder is only needed if the carve must pre-exist the C, e.g. a
committed WIP.) reverse.py seeds only the FIRST piece's INCLUDE_ASM — copy the full list
(all pieces, address order) from splat's generated
`.shake/gen/main.exe/src/<Name>.c`;
tools/permute.py concatenates all pieces for its target (fixed after this
bit a session); tools/matchdiff.py's window stops at the first piece — use
tools/asmdiff.py (sizes from the Ghidra export) for iteration and
matchdiff's whole-image count only as the gate. permute.py orders the
concatenated pieces by first-instruction address (lexicographic sorting is
wrong: caseD_1f before caseD_2, switchD last).

## gp vs absolute globals (item-TU vs think-TU)

**A bare `lui $rN, 0xHHHH` with NO following `addiu`, whose register is then
reused as a base for several `lbu/sb`-style accesses (often hoisted into a
branch delay slot so both arms share it), means the source held the address in a
LOCAL via a literal pointer cast** — `PersistentState *ps = (PersistentState
*)0x80010000;`, the convention already used by
`BriefingAndInventorySelectionScreen.c`'s `PSTATE`, `FUN_800565f0.c`,
`FUN_800566c0.c`. Spell the same access as a plain `extern u8 D_80010047;` and
cc1 folds the absolute address into each memory operand instead, so `as`
re-materialises `%hi` per use through `$at` (`lui $at,0x8001; sb $v0,71($at)`) —
extra `lui`s and the *wrong length*, not merely a register tie. The `lui`
survives alone only because the object's `%lo` is 0, so the cast's constant
needs exactly one instruction (FUN_8001b2b8).

**An absolute global that is read, modified and re-read across a call wants a raw
address-literal macro, not a named `extern`.** `InitGraphicsSystem`'s tail is
`STARTING_RNG_SEED = STARTING_RNG_SEED + VSync(-1); srand(STARTING_RNG_SEED);`.
A named `extern s32 STARTING_RNG_SEED;` compiles the load and the store through the
generic assembler pseudo-ops (`lw $r,SYM` / `sw $r,SYM`), each independently
`lui`-expanded: one instruction too many, and the store cannot be stolen into the
following `jal srand` delay slot. Spelling it
`#define STARTING_RNG_SEED (*(s32 *)0x80010e70)` makes cc1 commit to explicit
`lui`+`ori` constant-load RTL, which it CSEs across the read and the write, freeing
reorg to fill the call's delay slot with the store — the exact target sequence.
Verified against the pinned cc1: the named extern and a pointer temp both fail; only
the raw literal matches. This is the read-modify-reread-across-a-call counterpart to
the bare-`lui` rule above.

ASPSX gp-addresses only symbols **defined in the TU being assembled**;
externs are always absolute (`lui $at`/dest-reg expansion of the one-line
macro). Our per-file `maspsxGpExterns` list in `Build.hs` encodes "smalls the
original TU defined". Full story + evidence in
[toolchain.md](toolchain.md#gp-globals-making-small-globals-byte-match-solved--per-tu-opt-in).
Cross-TU aliasing reaches struct FIELD addresses too, not just top-level
globals: `CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR` (item TU) is byte-identical
to `CamState + 0x10` = `CamState.Owner`'s address — check an m2c "mystery
symbol"'s arithmetic against already-proven struct layouts before treating it
as new.

**A missing `--gp-extern` entry silently relocates a whole data region.** Drop one
file's entry from `maspsxGpExterns` and maspsx synthesizes stray local placeholders
that the linker prefers over the real symbols; the link SUCCEEDS and the image is
simply wrong. Measured: removing `CVArun`'s entry moved **388 symbols by +16 bytes**
each. `tools/symcheck.py` catches this in one second by asserting the invariant that
a symbol named `D_<HEX>` must resolve to `0x<HEX>`. Run it after any build in which
you converted an `INCLUDE_ASM` stub to real C.

Two corrections to what was first believed about this bug, both established by
removing each change independently on a clean tree:
- The load-bearing fix is **the matched function's own gp-extern list**. Nothing else.
- Pinning `D_XXXX = 0xXXXX;` in `config/symbols.<target>.txt`, and adding gp-extern
  entries for *sibling stub files* still on `INCLUDE_ASM`, are **defensive no-ops**
  today: the build is byte-identical without them. Keep them (they cost nothing and
  may matter once the siblings are matched) but do not reach for them first.

Practical rule: `tools/maspsxflags.py <Name> --write` derives the set from the
split asm's `%gp_rel(...)`, syncs both lists, and also handles guarded variable
division flags. (`gpsyms.py` remains the gp-only primitive.) Build.hs exposes the
per-file gp flags through a Shake **oracle** (`GpFlags`), so editing the list
invalidates exactly the affected `.s` on the next build — no manual clean, no
cache-busting (a gp-list edit used to survive stale because Shake can't see a
`cmd_` argument change; the oracle makes it a tracked dependency). Needing
absolute → keep the symbol off the list (a plain small extern).

- **-msplit-addresses is effectively ON in the pinned cc1**: non-small
  extern symbols compile to compiler-level HIGH/LO_SUM through ALLOCATED
  regs (`lui rA,%hi / addiu rB,rA,%lo`, two-reg pairs possible, %hi
  loop-hoistable, reorg can steal the lui into a delay slot); small (≤ -G8)
  symbols keep the one-line macro that maspsx/as expand via $at (stores) or
  the dest reg (loads). Tell: $at = small-symbol macro; allocated-reg lui =
  non-small split. Force the non-small path per-TU with an unknown-size
  extern array. A block copy whose source address builds as a two-reg
  lui/addiu pair is a plain extern struct assignment under split-addresses;
  flat `*(T *)0x…` casts become same-reg li macros instead. A hoisted
  lui-only base + per-iteration `addiu rD,base,disp` arg is a block-local
  round-constant pointer (`char *hi = (char *)0x80090000;`) whose uses sit
  inside a label-broken loop window (FileOption).
  - **Offset-0 folds, a nonzero offset materializes — and the addiu is always
    the DECLARED symbol's own address.** A non-small extern accessed at offset 0
    (bare scalar, struct field, or index 0 — verified 4/8/36/40 bytes) never gets
    a standalone `addiu`: cc1 shares one `lui` and folds `%lo(sym)` into each
    load/store's displacement (4 insns). A nonzero constant offset forces full
    materialization (`lui`+`addiu` forming the declared symbol's *own* address,
    never partially absorbing the extra offset), and the offset applies purely as
    the consuming access's displacement (5 insns). This diagnoses ordinary game
    TUs, but it is not a universal dead end: stock PsyQ objects may have been built
    with different address-splitting defaults. LIBMCRD's `MemCardCallback` proves
    the exception. Its original object relocations identify a private offset-0 BSS
    callback slot, and `-mno-split-addresses` preserves one unsplit `la` feeding the
    load and store: `lui`+`addiu` forms the exact final address, both accesses use
    displacement 0, and the leaf is the target five instructions. Before inventing
    an enclosing struct for this shape, establish whether the function is a stock
    library routine and inspect the shipped SDK object. Encode a proven difference
    narrowly in Build.hs's per-TU `ccExtraFlags`; mirror it in
    `tools/permute.py`'s `CC_EXTRA_FLAGS` so permuter/RTL diagnostics compile the
    same object, then require `Build check-all`.
- **≤8-byte externs are -G8-small: their address is one `la` (lui+addiu into
  the SAME register); a split `lui rA,%hi / addiu rB,rA,%lo` across TWO
  registers means the original declaration was NOT small** — respell as an
  unknown-size array (`extern SVECTOR D_80097B88[];`): unknown size is
  non-small, cc1 emits separate HIGH/LO_SUM pseudos and the hi temp gets the
  first free caller-saved reg. Raw-constant casts give `lui+ori` (wrong), a
  pointer temp to a small extern still collapses to `la`
  (DebugMenuItemSet's smoke vector).
  - **Counterexample — an 8-byte object is not automatically small in practice**:
    an 8-byte struct consumed by a whole-struct assignment can still want the
    non-small two-register hi/lo split. So don't reason from the size alone: if a
    plain scalar extern yields one shared register but the target uses two
    different ones, respell as an unknown-size array *even at exactly 8 bytes*
    (DoBriefingAndInventorySelection's `extern RECT D_80097698[];`, indexed
    `[0]` — 14 bytes off as a plain `extern RECT`; ProcItemGun's two 8-byte
    `extern SVECTOR D_80097B0C[];`/`D_80097B14[];` on that same `D_80097Bxx`
    table, +1 insn as plain `extern SVECTOR` — the `lui` reorg only hoists into
    the dispatch delay slot once the split forces a two-register HIGH/LO_SUM).
    The same rule applies to a four-byte pointer cell. PutMap's scalar
    `extern Humanoid *CURRENTLY_SELECTED_CHARACTER_STATE_PTR` stayed one
    assembler pseudo-load, so reorg could not move its eventual `lui` into the
    case-test delay slot and the body needed a load-hazard `nop`. Declaring the
    alias as `extern Humanoid *...[]` and reading `[0]` exposed the HIGH
    producer to cc1; reorg hoisted it into the dispatch slot and scheduled an
    unrelated table `lui` into the load delay, closing the exact 532-byte
    match.
  - **Interleave tell — how to SPOT the split from the asm**: when another
    instruction sits *between* a symbol's `lui %hi` and its `lw/sw %lo` half, the
    original was NOT a small extern — a small extern is ONE `la`/macro insn whose
    two halves sched1 cannot pull apart, so anything landing between them proves a
    two-register HIGH/LO_SUM that only an unknown-size array (`extern T SYM[];` …
    `SYM[0]`) reproduces. Read it straight off the diff: hi and lo of the same
    symbol not adjacent ⇒ respell as the array (ReqItemUse's guard-pointer and
    the `..._[0] = 3` store).
  - **Now mechanized:** `tools/autorules.py` (rule `extern-array`) sweeps this
    automatically — it flips every file-local `extern T NAME;` to
    `extern T NAME[];` + `NAME`→`NAME[0]` and keeps the flip if it moves bytes.
    So on a fresh draft you rarely apply it by hand; run autorules first and it
    finds the split for you (it only touches decls in the `.c`, never a shared
    header). It first parses the target split asm and **skips every symbol used
    with `%gp_rel`**: an unknown-size array would force precisely the wrong
    absolute-address path there, and a misleading partial-score improvement is
    not evidence against the target. Reach for the manual respelling only when
    the decl lives in a header autorules won't edit.
    FUN_80037e0c independently confirms the data-object form: declaring the
    fixed SVECTOR bytes as unknown-size `u8 D_80097A58[]` and casting at the
    load kept HIGH/LO_SUM in separate registers and allowed the target's
    intervening stack-copy schedule.
- **`lui`+`addiu(base)`, scaled index, then load at `0(base+index)` identifies a
  real named array.** A magic absolute pointer plus indexing often lets cc1 fold
  the address's low half into the final load displacement, losing the target's
  standalone base materialization. Resolve the address against the symbol/data
  map, declare the table with its real element width/count, and index it by
  name. DamageControl's eight-entry `D_80086B6C[deg]` motion table restored both
  the correct sequence and the exact function length.
- **A callee-saved value dying at a call whose result lands in the SAME
  s-register is the call-result variable HOSTING the earlier load**:
  `h = pm->locate.coord.t[1]; gy = h; … h = GetAreaMapLevel(…, gy, …);` —
  the lw lands in h's pseudo, gy coalesces onto it, and the post-call
  `move sN,v0` reuses the register once gy dies. Loading gy directly leaves
  h caller-saved and drifts the whole tail (DebugMenuItemSet, permuter
  find; same family as the variable-reuse rule).

### The permuter aborts on rand()-calling functions (KeyError 'rand')

decomp-permuter throws `KeyError: 'rand'` in `perm_add_mask` on EFFECT.C spawners (a
typemap gap for `rand()`-calling functions; also seen on FUN_8003944c). It could not
reach the pool-scan addu operand tie anyway — that order is chosen after `fold` in RTL,
below the C AST the permuter transforms. Recognise these and park; do not budget
permuter time.

### Declaring scratch jitter values as one array forces stack residency

For an EFFECT spawner whose three jitter scratch values (px/py/pz) must live on the
stack (the target block-copies them, so they cannot stay in registers), declaring them
as one `long p[3];` instead of three scalars forces genuine stack residency and moves
the residual toward the target (`SetBleedsDir`: 88 → 68 bytes). Part of the still-open
"throwaway scratch + second block-copy" residual that SetBleeds/SetSmoke share.

**Separate single-definition rand temps preserve return-register coalescing; a
named base temp preserves which side owns the bias.** For repeated
`coordinate - BIAS + rand() % RANGE` expressions, use one `random_x/y/z` per
call and split `base_x = coordinate - BIAS; result = base_x + random_x % RANGE`.
Each single-def call result coalesces with `$v0`; one reused multi-def `random`
creates a copy after every call. The named base prevents combine from
reassociating the bias onto the remainder, which otherwise sinks the coordinate
load and removes its target load-hazard `nop`. This exact three-expression shape
fixed ProcItemFire's last structural gap. When the target instead has the
reassociated form, inline `rand()` and the bias—the two spellings are deliberate
opposites. DrawShadow independently confirmed the return-register half of this
rule with four `rand()` calls. Its first call had to stay before an unrelated Y
adjustment, so blindly inlining the call at the use would have changed side-effect
order. `tools/autorules.py NAME --rules call-result-split` mechanizes the safe
version: it atomically gives each direct-call definition a single-use local while
leaving every call at its original statement position.

### Hoist-invariant vs widen-parameter can be a 2-instruction allocator tie

A hand-rolled `do {} while (1)` loop that has BOTH a repeatedly-used address/constant
invariant worth hoisting to a dedicated register AND a parameter compared only via the
no-`sra` double-left-shift trick can tie: the target dedicates a register to the raw
parameter (re-deriving its widened form cheaply each iteration) so another register is
free to cache the invariant across the loop, while a draft that fully widens the
parameter into one persistent register leaves nothing free and recomputes the invariant
each iteration. Both cost the same 2 instructions; no operand-order or De-Morgan rewrite
of the compare reliably picks the target's path. RTL-escalation territory, not
respelling (`SetSmoke`).

**Any literal reused across >=2 calls inside one loop needs its own named local,
assigned once before the loop, to be promoted to a callee-saved register instead of
re-materialising (`li`/`lui`) at every use.** Not just sentinels -- a bitmask, a fixed
call argument, a comparison constant all qualify (`RestoreItemLayout`'s compare sentinel,
`LoadOrnamentArchive`'s OR-mask + literal call-flag).

## loop.c hoisting is a threshold economy (the invariant-hoist model)

`move_movables` hoists a loop invariant iff `threshold * savings * lifetime >=
insn_count`. `threshold` starts at `(loop_has_call ? 1 : 2) * (1 + n_non_fixed_regs)`
— **29** for a call-containing loop on this target — and **decays by 3 for each movable
already moved**. Every decision is printed in the `-da` `.loop` dump
(`Insn N: regno R (life L), savings S moved / not desirable`), so you can solve for the
threshold and PREDICT the fix instead of permuting for it. Three levers follow:

- **Guard operand order controls whether a short parameter's widening hoists.** In a
  call-containing loop, `if (i >= n)` (counter first) emits `n`'s sign-extension pair
  adjacent to the `slt` → lifetime 2 → stays in-loop, and combine folds both extensions
  into a no-`sra` `sll/sll/slt`, keeping raw `short n` in one callee-saved reg. The
  reversed `if (n <= i)` gives the pair lifetime 4 → loop.c hoists the widening into its
  own register and the compare degrades to `sll/sra/slt`. Which operand's `sll` comes
  first in the target's compare reads the source operand order off directly.
- **A USER-variable invariant assignment is hoistable only if it precedes any conditional
  exit.** `base = EffectSlot;` as the FIRST body statement (before `if (…) return;`) is a
  movable (its `lui/addiu` lands in the prologue, both `base+idx` and the wrap-reset read
  one cached reg). The same statement AFTER the guard is `maybe_never` and ineligible —
  and assigning `base` ABOVE the loop in source mismatches too (next point).
- **The −3-per-move decay is load-bearing: an early hoist keeps a LATER invariant
  in-loop.** SetSmoke needs `time<<16` un-hoisted: after `base`'s two moves plus the
  `%100` magic, threshold is 29−9=20 → `20*2*3 < 153` → stays. Writing `base` above the
  loop instead moves only the magic (−3), and `26*2*3 >= 153` hoists the `time<<16` chain
  and spills n/time to stack. WHERE an invariant is assigned changes unrelated
  expressions' fates later in the body.

**Identical invariant else-arm constants COMBINE, so their hoist savings SUM.** cse
unifies `-shortvar` across arms into one pseudo and `combine_movables` does
`m->savings += m1->savings`, so three per-arm `negu`s hoist together
(`29*3*3 >= insn_count`) even though one alone stays (`29*1*3 < insn_count`). To keep the
literal per-arm `negu` the target has: leave ONE arm as plain `-x`, and spell the others
`zN - x` with `int zN = 0;` single-set/single-use vars initialised ABOVE the loop. Each
minus is then a SOLO movable (different regs → no rtx match → stays), zN's alloc priority
is rock-bottom (its REG_EQUIV note doubles its live length), and update_equiv_regs/reload
substitute const-0 into `subsi3`'s `reg_or_0_operand`, emitting `negu` with zero trace of
zN in the binary (`SetBleeds`). 

Two corollaries: loop.c DELETES single-use register copies inside a call-containing loop
(`reg_single_usage` substitution in scan_loop), so a `tmp = n;` copy cannot block
invariance — don't bother; and fold reassociates `(x - 1) - (a + b)` into `x - (a+b+1)`,
so an own-statement temp (`m = smoke->mode - 1;`) is needed to keep the literal `addiu -1`
on x's side. (`SetSmoke`, whole outer loop. `-da` dumps the `.loop` numbers; `-dd` dumps
reorg/dbr for delay-slot questions.)

### Recover an unbiased cursor plus surviving counter with a goto and explicit hoists

When the target walks a pointer at NATURAL field offsets (unbiased) AND keeps an
independent counter for a constant-bound top test, structured C loops can force a false
choice: `items[i]` gives the unbiased GIV, but loop.c derives it from the counter and
`maybe_eliminate_biv` DROPS the counter; an explicit `it++` keeps the counter but loop.c
biases the cursor to a frequently-used field and spends an extra callee-saved register.
The `.loop` dump names both outcomes ("giv … mult N add (reg base)" and "biv M can be
eliminated").

There is a pure-C recovery: use a literal label/back-edge `goto`, keep the counter and
walking pointer as separate locals, and explicitly cache every invariant base before the
label in the target's preheader order.  The goto prevents loop.c from inventing or
eliminating either induction variable, so the cursor retains natural offsets.  It also
prevents automatic loop-invariant hoisting; the named preheader caches deliberately put
those lost bases back.  UpdateItemState needed `i = 0; view = &ViewInfo; conflicts =
ConflictObject; item = items;`, then a top test and literal `goto loop`; this changed its
previous exact-length 293-byte residual into an exact 440-byte match.

Two finishing details can follow from the same split.  If the target rematerializes the
first access to a global but keeps a base for later fields, use the global directly for
the first access and the cached pointer for the later ones.  If an indexed cached base
leaves only a commuted `addu base,index` residual, form the address as an integer sum with
the scaled index written first, then cast back to the pointer type; UpdateItemState's
`(s32)idx * sizeof(*object) + (u32)conflicts` retained the target's
`addu index,index,base` operand order.

## Dividing by a variable needs `--expand-div`

**A `%` or `/` by a runtime VALUE (not a constant) compiles shorter than the target
unless the function is on the `--expand-div` list.** ASPSX guards both signed and
unsigned division with `break 7` (divide-by-zero). Signed `div` additionally has
`break 6` for the INT_MIN/-1 overflow case; unsigned `divu` has no corresponding
overflow guard. maspsx only reproduces those guards under `--expand-div`. Without
it maspsx emits a bare division/result sequence and the draft assembles short,
shifting everything after it (a common cause of a whole-function length mismatch).

The tell, before you even build: **Ghidra renders the guards as `trap(0x1c00)` and
`trap(0x1800)`** — seeing those in the reference C means the TU divides by a variable.
In the target `.s`, signed `div` is followed by `break 7` and `break 6`, while
unsigned `divu` is followed by `break 7` alone. Division by a CONSTANT is normally
a magic-multiply with no guards and needs nothing.

Fix: add the function to BOTH `extra "<Name>" = ["--expand-div"]` in
`shake/src/Build.hs` and `"<Name>": ["--expand-div"]` in `tools/permute.py`'s
`MASPSX_EXTRA`. The EFFECT.C spawners are prone to this (`rand() % time`,
`rand() % srange` etc.): `SetSmoke` (1 variable div, 2 breaks) and `SetBleeds`
(3 variable divs) both need it; the already-matched `IsVisible`/`ComputeAreaLevel`/
`bow_shoot_logic` are on the list for the same reason.

This edit is now mechanical: `tools/maspsxflags.py <Name> --write` reads the
target split assembly, recognizes the signed guard pair or unsigned single guard,
and synchronizes this flag alongside any `%gp_rel` externs. ProcItemNapalm is the
worked combined case (one guarded character-model remainder plus six gp-relative
`D_80097F60` loads). `FUN_80036284` is the unsigned worked case: its six `divu`
operations each have only `break 7`; that exposed and fixed the detector's former
signed-only assumption.

## Matching `main`

**`main` never calls `__main()` explicitly.** gcc auto-inserts the C-runtime `__main()`
at the top of any function literally named `main`, and reorg fills its delay slot with
the first callee-saved save. Writing `__main();` in the source compiles a SECOND call --
2 bytes over. Leave it out; only the implicit one is real.

**A `main` with an outsized frame but no matching stack access has a dead aggregate
local.** Retail `main`'s frame holds a large local (~248 B) that neither Ghidra nor m2c
renders (both optimise it away). Size a `u8 dead[0xNN];` to hit the frame -- the frame
size is the only evidence (the demo's own `i`/`dat`/`rect` locals were stripped in
retail). The "unexplained frame gap = unused aggregate" rule applied to main.

## Toolchain gotchas

- **A literal added to a value that only ever feeds a NARROW (byte) store can
  canonicalize to its negative-equivalent immediate**: `x + 0x80` compiles as
  `addiu ...,-128` because only the low 8 bits survive the `sb`. If the target
  shows the positive encoding, route the literal through a named variable
  (`s32 bias = 0x80;`) used at both addition sites (SelectCameraOwnerOption).
  The same principle applies when one computed coordinate fans out to several
  byte fields: compute it once in an `s32` temp and then assign the bytes. This
  prevents modulo-256 folding and gives allocation one full-width pseudo to
  reuse (SetupTelop's final `u`/`v` stores). If a scratch is dead before that
  tail, reusing the later temp name earlier can also be a zero-code allocation
  lever: SetupTelop fed its halfword bitmap store through the later `final_u`
  pseudo, reducing the final register cycle without changing the value or
  adding a live range across the intervening calls. Confirm the change in
  `.lreg`; do not create an artificial long-lived local blindly.

- **A repeated `&local` passed to the same callee twice does NOT reliably get
  recomputed.** cc1 can CSE the address across an intervening conditional even
  when a genuine two-predecessor `CODE_LABEL` sits between the call sites — which
  contradicts the "a label breaks the CSE window" expectation elsewhere in this
  file. If the target recomputes the stack address fresh at each site and your
  draft caches it in two extra callee-saved registers, there is currently no
  known source lever (LoadSI, parked; wants a `-dg`/`-di` dump session).


- **The PsyQ SDK block (`0x80060000+`: CRT/libcd/libapi) was built by a DIFFERENT
  compiler — don't source-shape it.** `Exec`/`__main`/`__SN_ENTRY_POINT`/`Cd*`/
  `PC*`/`EVENT_OBJ_*`/`DeliverEvent`/`_SN_*` are precompiled library objects, not
  game TUs. The tell: for a trivial (ra-only) frame our cc1's `mips_expand_epilogue`
  ALWAYS emits `restore-ra; addiu sp,sp,N; jr ra` with reorg pulling the `addiu`
  into `jr`'s delay slot — but these objects leave the delay slot a bare `nop` with
  the sp-restore BEFORE the jump, a shape our cc1 never produces at any `-O`/body
  (verified via `-dd`/`.dbr` dumps + the gcc-2.8.1 sources) and permuter-immune.
  So a few-byte epilogue residual on a `0x80060xxx` function is a compiler-version
  mismatch, not a source problem — don't chase it. `triage.py`/`progress.py` now
  cut the game/SDK boundary at `0x80060000`; also note `EVENT_OBJ_80/90/BC` etc.
  aren't even standalone functions (they're shared epilogues of `CdInit` and its
  retry wrapper — splat carved them only because they had symbol names).
- **`sll r,r,16 / sra r,r,k / sra r,r,16-k` (k≠16) is a sign-extension FUSED
  with a left-scale, and has no natural-C form.** A plain "index an array by a
  `short`" always compiles to the textbook 2-shift `sll16/sra16`, and cc1's
  fold/combine refolds *every* plain-arithmetic respelling back to it (nested
  expression, two statements, K&R params, explicit pointer casts, a static-inline
  helper, even a literal transcription of the asm shifts — all verified against
  cc1 `-da` RTL dumps + the gcc-2.8.1 sources). A synthetic optimizer barrier
  can reproduce it experimentally, but under the inline-asm anti-rule above that
  is evidence that the natural C remains unresolved, not a matching solution.
  Whole game code contains exactly three, all parked: `GetPad`, `FUN_8001b174`,
  `GetPadXY`. `triage.py` detects the triple and reports `SIGNEXT-SPLIT (GetPad
  class)` instead of rating it TRIVIAL; `autorules` deliberately does not try the
  barrier form.
  - **Do NOT confuse this with the ordinary 2-instruction `sll r,r,16 / sra
    r,r,K` (K≠16)**, which is just a `short`/HImode index sign-extended *and*
    scaled in one go — exactly what `arr[short_i]` compiles to for a 4-byte
    stride. That shape is perfectly matchable (`GetHumanoid`, `DisposeWeapon`).
    The blocked class is specifically **three** instructions: a pure sign-extend
    split into two `sra`s summing to 16, with **no** scale folded in.
    `triage.py`'s detector already requires the 3-insn form, so it will not
    false-positive here.
- **PS1 GTE command opcodes: handled by splat; matching is now SANCTIONED via
  the restricted `gte.h` layer (owner decision 2026-07-16 — docs/gte-policy.md).**
  Our `mipsel-...-as` (binutils 2.40, `-march=r3000`) is vanilla MIPS: the COP2
  *data moves* (`lwc2`/`swc2`/`mfc2`/`mtc2`/`cfc2`/`ctc2`) assemble, but the GTE
  *command* opcodes (`RTPS`/`RTPT`/`NCLIP`/`DPCS`/`DPCT`/`MVMVA`/…) are
  `unrecognized opcode` on their own. **splat >= 0.4x generates
  `include/gte_macros.inc` (68 macros) and has `macro.inc` include it**, so it
  emits them as lowercase mnemonics that assemble through those macros. The whole
  renderer region is splittable and all 25 GTE functions are carved;
  `./Build check` is byte-identical. (We briefly carried our own `tools/gte2word.py`
  that rewrote each mnemonic to a `.word`; splat 0.41 superseded it and it is gone.
  If you ever need the encoding by hand, note splat's `/* addr vaddr WORD */`
  comment column is the raw little-endian file bytes in address order, NOT the
  instruction word — `RTPT` prints `3000284A` and is `.word 0x4A280030`.)
  - **MATCHING them is now allowed, narrowly**: no C construct emits a GTE
    opcode and the render handlers use a non-ABI entry convention (values live
    in `$t2..$t5`/`$s0` at entry), so functions whitelisted in
    `config/gte-allowlist.txt` use the shared macro layer `src/main.exe/gte.h`
    (PsyQ INLINE_N.H-style names; COP2 data moves as native mnemonics, GTE
    commands as `.word 0x4A......` — the `.c` pipeline's `as` input does not
    include splat's `gte_macros.inc`) plus `register long x __asm__("$12");`
    pinned locals for the non-ABI entries. Verified end-to-end by `SetDepthQ`
    (byte-exact first build): cc1 passes `#APP` blocks through, maspsx ignores
    the markers and leaves unknown COP2 mnemonics alone, `as` assembles the
    data moves natively. `__asm__` outside `gte.h` remains an automatic
    matchdiff blocker, and `test_matching_tools.py` pins the containment +
    whitelist. `DrawTMD` is whitelisted despite containing no GTE opcode (its
    handler dispatch needs pinned live registers).
    ArrangeLocalMatrix was previously listed here too, but that was a false
    inference from its dense use of `$t2..$t6`: those are ordinary internal
    loop temporaries, while both calls use ABI `$a0/$a1`. Its complete
    636-byte body now matches in pure C.
  - **The drawF3 anchor's verified GTE-family conventions** (reuse for the
    compiled-style GTE functions; full detail in drawF3.c + gte.h):
    file-scope GLOBAL register variables (`register int x __asm__("$16");` at
    file scope) reserve a callee-saved/handed-back register with NO
    prologue save — a local reg var forces the 4-instruction save pair; a
    global reg var also keeps "dead" writes alive and out of the `jr` delay
    slot. Compute each guard's delay-slot value BEFORE its `if` — reorg's
    backward simple-fill sinks it into the previous guard's slot even when it
    clobbers a loop-carried register. A `goto`-loop (label + `if(c) goto`)
    carries NO loop notes, so loop.c hoists nothing — use it when the target
    rematerializes invariants per-iteration. Un-pin a loop-carried pointer
    the target reuses for transients by seeding a regular variable from a
    pinned reader (cc1 coalesces the seed; direct pinning forces scratch+move).
    An "m"-constraint COP2 macro folds a struct-member offset into the
    instruction displacement (`lwc2 $6,4($t5)` from `gte_ldrgb(prim->rgb)`).
    Splitting `a+b+c` into `x=a+b; x+=c;` and vertex `idx*8+base` into
    all-sll-then-all-addu statements controls accumulator choice and batches
    the scheduler.
  - **One park-on-sight cc1 invariant (any function, not just GTE):** the
    target byte-form `addiu r,$zero,0` for `x = 0` is UNREACHABLE from plain C
    (cc1 movsi always emits `move r,$0`; nonzero constants correctly give
    `li`). The whole draw*/DrawTMD family has this tell (one per handler, two in
    DrawTMD); see docs/gte-policy.md for the scan and the independent non-ABI
    calling-convention evidence. Do **not** use reversed equality operands as
    the same proof: a direct equality between fixed `$v0/$v1` values does
    canonicalize lower-regno first, but a subtract-then-zero-test through the
    fixed `$v1` carrier combines to `beq $v1,$v0`. drawF3 now uses that pure-C
    form and matches the opening branch exactly.
  - **A COMPILED GTE caller needs `nop;nop` before every GTE command; a
    HANDWRITTEN one does not.** The command reads the COP2 register file, which
    is not stable until 2 cycles after the preceding `lwc2`/`swc2`, and cc1
    cannot schedule across the opaque `.word`. A compiled caller has its loads
    and command adjacent, so the original's PsyQ macro carried the nops — a
    draft exactly 2 instructions SHORT PER COMMAND is this (FUN_80058c70).
    Handwritten authors filled the latency with real work (drawF3 uses a
    `lui/ori`), so their reconstructions need the bare command. `gte.h` carries
    both spellings — `gte_<cmd>()` vs `gte_<cmd>_raw()` — and a unit test pins
    handwritten files to `_raw`: applying the nop form to drawF3 silently added
    6 instructions and put it 24 bytes over its carve, which **fuzz-score did
    not catch — only the linked length did**.
  - **The permuter cannot search a `gte.h` function AT ALL**: its C parser
    rejects inline asm (`base.c does not contain any function!`). This class is
    not "one bounded run then park" — the run is impossible. `permute.py` now
    refuses it with that message and points at `rtlguide`/`rtldump`; escalate
    straight to `.loop`/`.greg`.
  - **A `u16` loop counter that only helps in a do-while is a strength-reduction
    artifact, not the real type.** If `u16` beats `int` only because `int`
    strength-reduces, the counter IS `int` and the LOOP SHAPE is wrong:
    suppress loop.c with a goto-loop and `int` wins (the target's unmasked
    `bnez` proves it). FUN_80058c70's do-while additionally made loop.c
    synthesize a second induction register while `Cannot eliminate biv N` kept
    the bare cursor alive — a double cursor and a whole-function cascade.
  - **Take a prototype from the matched CALLER, not from Ghidra.**
    FUN_80058a54 gave FUN_80058c70's real types (`u_short *primitive,
    u_long vertices, …`) where Ghidra guessed all-`int`; byte-neutral there but
    load-bearing for faithfulness (a `u_short*` cursor advances by 5, not 20).
  - **m2c can read them**: our m2c carries a PSX GTE/COP2 patch series
    (`nix/m2c/*.patch`). You MUST pass `--input-regs`, or every entry-live value
    becomes `M2C_ERROR(Read from unset register)`. Hand it the whole caller-saved
    file and let m2c ignore the unused ones:
    `--input-regs v0,v1,a0,a1,a2,a3,t0,t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8,t9,s0`
    → zero `M2C_ERROR` on `FUN_8005d1fc`.
- **Whether loop.c hoists a set: read the THREE disjuncts, they are independent.**
  loop.c:691-703 moves a set if (1) it is used only in the set's own basic block
  (`reg_in_basic_block_p`), OR (2) `!REG_USERVAR_P(SET_DEST(set)) &&
  !REG_LOOP_TEST_P(...)`, OR (3) the set is guaranteed executed once the loop
  starts. Two useful consequences, and they pull in opposite directions:
  - A named base under a conditional and used in ANOTHER block fails all three,
    while a compiler TEMP — what a direct indexed reference
    (`WeaponModel[0].wid`) produces — takes case (2) and hoists freely. So a fix
    for a missing hoist is often to DELETE the variable.
  - **But case (1) is a STANDALONE disjunct that ignores both `maybe_never` and
    `REG_USERVAR_P`**: a NAMED user variable hoists freely anyway if every use
    sits in the set's own block. (AddEnemy: relocating `menu_base = ItemName`
    below the think scan made it a third movable, hoisted after the base, exactly
    as retail has it — after two rounds had called that order unreachable.) Do
    not read "named variables don't hoist" as a law; read the disjuncts.
  - **Corollary — a giv init is the ONLY thing that can legally sit after a hoist
    in a preheader.** `strength_reduce` (loop.c:6405) emits giv inits after
    `move_movables` has run, whereas a source pre-loop statement can only ever
    PRECEDE the hoists. So a preheader value that must follow a hoist is a giv,
    never a source statement — and if you are hand-spelling it, that is the bug.
    (AddEnemy: there is no `names_offset` variable at all — it and `count` update
    in lockstep from 0, so `names_offset == count*20` identically; the source is
    just `buffer = (char *)names[count]` and loop.c strength-reduces the biv.
    Hand-writing it misplaced both the init and the increment: as a giv the
    `addiu s7,s7,20` lands at the biv update point, where sched1 stops floating
    it and dbr fills sprintf's delay slot with it as retail does — a 16-byte
    cluster on its own.)
  - **A `do{}while(0)` cannot fix a preheader ORDER problem.** The fence pins
    order *within* a block; hoist placement is decided in loop.c, long before
    sched1 ever runs.
  - **A `do{}while(0)` also CANNOT ballast a set that loop.c HOISTS.**
    `move_movables` emits the insn with `emit_insn_before(loop_start)`, which
    lifts it OUT of the fence's `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END` region — so it loses the
    loop_depth weighting entirely. Ballast only works on sets that STAY PUT.
    (Measured: a FENCE_10 on a relocated, hoisted `menu_base = ItemName` changed
    nothing at all, 97 -> 97.) This bounds the "fence depth is a dial" rule: the
    dial does nothing when the set escapes the fence.
- **Hand-written spill arrays model caller-save.c — delete them and check.**
  AddEnemy's `blood.call_spill[]`-style spills looked load-bearing, but gcc
  spilled the same bases to the same slots (sp+0x7e0/sp+0x7e4) by itself; the
  hack only ever looked right because it agreed with what caller-save already did.
- **`REG_N_DEATHS` is an independent local-alloc lever.** `local_alloc` seeds
  `reg_qty[i] = -2` (i.e. TIE-ABLE) only when
  `REG_BASIC_BLOCK(i) >= 0 && REG_N_DEATHS(i) == 1`, and `combine_regs` bails
  with `if (reg_qty[sreg] >= -1) return 0;`. So **a value that dies on TWO paths
  can never be locally tied, whatever its live range.** When a temp is wrongly
  coalesced into a longer-lived pseudo (inheriting its call-crossing
  callee-saved home), duplicate the consuming copy into BOTH arms of a branch:
  the pseudo then has two deaths, the tie is refused, and no live range is
  extended. (mission_score_screen's medal temp: this returned it to the target's
  `$v0` while keeping the copy in the bgez delay slot. It is the cookbook's `%hi`
  reload-tie guard run INVERTED — there you make a tie happen, here you make it
  refuse.)
- **Diff the region a "missing piece" lives in against the CURRENT draft BEFORE
  hunting it.** A defect attributed to the baseline may be collateral from the
  very edit that supposedly needs it. (mission_score_screen's 401 baseline
  already emitted the target's `lw/nop/addiu/li` exactly; round 7's own edit
  introduced the break, so "move pseudo 777 off `$s0`" was chasing its own
  collateral — four spellings failed before someone diffed the region.)
- **Screen REGISTER questions in a reduction; verify SCHEDULING questions in the
  REAL function.** A 25-line cc1-281 testbed reproduced both known allocation
  states exactly but FALSE-POSITIVED on a delay slot: the natural division
  spelling filled the slot in the reduction and was byte-neutral in the real
  function, because with one pseudo the copy is born post-join and only dbr's
  `fill_slots_from_thread` can steal it — which needs `sched2` to leave it as the
  block's first insn, and real register pressure defeats that. The testbed is
  still the cheapest instrument; just know which questions it can answer.
  **Second counter-example: results on COPY SURVIVAL do not transfer either** —
  ActSTICKON's testbed did not need the self-XOR that the real function required,
  because whether a copy survives depends on the surrounding register pressure.
- **A same-register `lui $rN,%hi(sym)` / `addiu $rN,$rN,%lo(sym)` pair is an
  UNSPLIT `la` — not a tied split — and the ONLY lever is the DECLARATION.**
  cc1's `movsi` expander splits addresses pre-reload into two DISTINCT pseudos
  (`gen_reg_rtx`), and local-alloc's `combine_regs` refuses to tie them when the
  destination is a multi-block pseudo — so a loop cursor's address init can NEVER
  be tied by any source restructuring. The split is declined only when
  `mips_check_split` sees `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG`, which `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO` (mips.h)
  sets iff the decl's type is **complete** and `0 < sizeof <= -G` (8). So
  `extern T x[];` is INCOMPLETE (`int_size_in_bytes` = -1, the `size > 0` test
  fails) and always splits. **Give the extern a complete type of size <= 8** to
  get the same-register form — the bound is a codegen knob, not a claim about the
  object's real length. RestoreItemLayout's entire 3-byte park fell to
  `extern short D_8008E404[];` -> `extern short D_8008E404[4];` — one character.
  - Corollary: **two address sites in one function can legitimately differ** (its
    `items` site splits, `D_8008E404` does not). That is a DECLARATION
    difference, never an allocator inconsistency — do not "fix" the consistent
    one.
  - When probing address shape, grep for `\bla\b` too: a first probe searching
    only `lui|%hi|%lo` reported "no address materialization" for exactly the
    variants that had produced the answer.
- **METHOD — when a residual looks unreachable, grep the whole game for the
  target's SHAPE and check whether any function with it is already MATCHED.**
  Our matched corpus is an oracle: a matched function's source IS the answer to
  "what C produces this?". FUN_80057b80's prologue emits the `a1`-copy before the
  `a0`-copy; exactly three functions in main.exe do that, and BOTH matched ones
  (`create_ninken_character_(s16 type, s32 stage)`, `cd_control(u8, u8*, u8*)`)
  have a NARROW first parameter. One grep settled what a lot of source-reading
  could not. Use this before any deep RTL dive.
  - **CAVEAT, learned by the same function one round later: match on the CAUSE,
    not the shape.** That very oracle produced a FALSE POSITIVE — it matched
    `create_ninken_character_` and `cd_control` on prologue SHAPE alone, and
    FUN_80057b80's first parameter turned out to be a pointer, which cannot
    produce that shape at all (below). Two functions can share a shape with
    incompatible causes. Before trusting a corpus hit, check that the
    *mechanism* transfers — here, the parameter's USE KIND (value vs pointer
    base), not the instruction pattern.
- **A first parameter narrower than a word has its copy DEFERRED past every other
  parameter copy.** `assign_parms` (function.c:4142) emits each arg-register copy
  inline in declaration order UNLESS `nominal_mode != passed_mode ||
  promoted_nominal_mode != promoted_mode`; then it emits `move tempreg,aN` inline
  but defers the real assignment into `conversion_insns`, flushed only after all
  parms (function.c:4439). tempreg coalesces into aN, so the deferred insn becomes
  a plain `move sX,aN` with a LUID GREATER than every other parm copy — and for an
  unsigned narrow type the truncation moves to the USE site, so it stays a bare
  `move`, not `sll/sra`. For a pointer or int this can NEVER fire (line 3789
  forces `passed_mode = nominal_mode = Pmode`).
  **But the deferred copy stays a bare `move` ONLY if the narrow parm is used as
  a VALUE.** gcc then keeps it in a promoted subreg and truncates lazily at the
  use sites (that is `cd_control`). Used as a POINTER BASE, the address must be
  materialised immediately, so the deferred insn IS the truncation and REPLACES
  the move (`andi $16,$4,0xff` for u8, `sll;sra` for s16 — measured in a
  testbed). So a prologue showing BOTH the a1-before-a0 order AND a bare
  `move sX,a0` with no truncation anywhere **cannot come from a narrow first
  parameter** — the two requirements are mutually exclusive. (FUN_80057b80:
  order requires narrowness, its pointer use puts the truncation in exactly that
  slot; the signature lever is closed, and its 8 bytes are a genuine
  compiler-INPUT difference.) The earlier form of this rule — "a1-copy first
  implies a narrow first parameter" — is too strong; it is a NECESSARY condition,
  not a sufficient one.
  Also banked from that investigation: the deferral gate is ONLY function.c:4142
  (the other five `push_to_sequence` sites are `#if 0`, or
  `FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES` which MIPS does not define, or the stack-parm
  else-branch); `promote_mode` never moves POINTER_TYPE except under
  `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED` (and Pmode is SImode anyway); and `passed_pointer`
  leaves both promoted modes SImode.
- **gcc 2.8.1's `sched.c` schedules each basic block BOTTOM-UP, and `priority()`
  (sched.c:1479) maxes over `LOG_LINKS` — PREDECESSORS.** So priority is depth
  from the block TOP, not critical-path-to-block-end (that is later-gcc/haifa
  behaviour — a real trap). The emitted order is the REVERSE of the pick order,
  and ready-list ties go to the HIGHEST LUID. Read `.sched2`'s
  `;; ready list at T-N: …` lines directly — they print every priority and every
  decision. Consequences: a later USE cannot raise an insn's priority (it is a
  successor, not a predecessor); two reg-reg moves are indistinguishable to every
  scheduler heuristic (same class, hazard 0), so **LUID is their only
  discriminator**; and the prologue (save, def) pair order is decided entirely by
  the DEF's LUID — `schedule_select` picks the largest `potential_hazard` in the
  first equal-priority group, and mips.md gives a store a memory unit while a
  reg-reg move has none, which is what drags each `sw` to sit just before its
  copy regardless of the order `save_restore_insns` emitted them in.
- **NEVER infer PRE-JUMP2 block structure from the final asm.** cse1 runs BEFORE
  jump2, and jump2's cross-jumping merges identical arms — erasing the very
  labels cse saw. So a store/reload pair that looks impossibly co-located in one
  block with no label may have been two arms at cse time. **A store that must not
  be forwarded belongs inside BOTH arms**: only a real join label stops cse's
  store-to-load forwarding, only arms supply one, and the `do{}while(0)` fence
  cannot (a loop note is a scheduling barrier, not an aliasing one). Corollary:
  Ghidra temps that look like pointless copies (`pMin`/`pCx`/`pCy`) can be
  ARTIFACTS of that late merge rather than source variables. This single
  restructuring took FUN_80057b80 from 494 to 8 bytes after three rounds had
  read the final asm and concluded a label was impossible.
  **The same trap catches register allocation, because cross-jumping runs AFTER
  it.** ActSTICKON's "a1/a0 vs a0/v0 register cycle" verdict was really a jump2
  artifact: the shared `li v0,K / bne a0,v0` tail is two case bodies differing
  only in `li v0,K`, merged after allocation. Modelling that merged tail as a
  source-level variable gave the constant a live range spanning the switch tree's
  own compare scratch, exiling it from `v0` and cascading the rest. Written as a
  plain switch on an UNSIGNED mode (the target's `sltiu`, not `slt`) with the
  literals inline per case, they become short-lived pseudos that reuse `v0` — and
  case order 6, 9, 7, 10 reproduces the fall-through layout.
- **A "narrowed negate" can never be sign-extended: `narrow = -narrowVar` is not
  the target's shape.** convert.c's `convert_to_integer` narrows `NEGATE_EXPR`
  THROUGH the truncation, so cc1 emits `negu` on the raw register and combine
  then folds the compare down to a bare `sll`. To get the target's `sll/sra` plus
  a `negu` on the EXTENDED value, the negation's operand must be a separate
  SImode variable — the sign_extend then has two uses (the compare and the
  negate), which also blocks that combine fold. (mission_score_screen's row
  draw; mechanical enough to be an autorules candidate.)
- **An argument-register copy cannot cross a call.** To place an arg copy in an
  earlier block (e.g. to fill a branch delay slot), introduce a second pointer —
  but its copy must be born AFTER any intervening call. Born before, the pseudo
  lives across the call, is forced callee-saved, and the `$a0` allocation you
  wanted never happens. (This is why mission_score_screen's round 4 concluded "a
  second pointer always fails" — it had placed the copy before the `rcos` call.)
  Related correction from the same lane: a dead-store blocker does NOT work "at
  any position" — at the end of a block it is a no-op and cc1 emits a
  byte-identical object; it must sit BETWEEN the copy and the copy's uses.
- **A `bgez` delay slot can be filled by the ASSEMBLER, not cc1.** cc1 emits
  `.set reorder`, and cc1's own dbr only considers the single immediately
  preceding insn — so do not reason about such a slot as if `dbr` chose it.
- **Length-neutral packages cannot land piecemeal — look for the payer.** The
  same FUN_80057b80 change was four "separate" sites that only worked together:
  two saved an instruction each (`sll/sra` -> `lh`), one gained a missing reload,
  and the net -1 exactly paid for a proven `+1` base pointer that had been
  unscoreable for three rounds because it overflowed the carve alone. When a
  proven finding costs +1 and is rejected on length, do not drop it — go find
  what pays for it. **Second instance, same rollout**: mission_score_screen's
  round 4 measured the two halves of its ±4 skew SEPARATELY, saw each break the
  1159-instruction extent, and parked both — its own note even said "both are the
  SAME parked ±4 pair" — but never combined them. Round 7 proved they are exactly
  complementary. When a note says two residuals are the same pair, that is an
  instruction to try them TOGETHER.
- **Test a shape in a STANDALONE 25-line `.c` compiled directly with cc1-281
  (~1 s/variant) before editing a 750-line draft.** Use `tools/rtldump.py`'s
  CC_FLAGS. FUN_80057b80's X box as a testbed reproduced the forwarding bug and
  then produced the target's exact sequence on the first try. This is the
  cheapest experiment in the toolkit and it is under-used.
- **A preceding statement is computed FIRST.** If the target computes a base
  pointer in argument order, spell it INLINE in the call and let cse merge the
  occurrences (FUN_80057b80's third `gte_stsz3` pointer: 42 -> 36).
- **Two `maspsx` counting traps** (both manufactured a phantom "+3 surplus refs"
  and a false theory): maspsx emits `nop # DEBUG: ... 'sh $2,44($16)' ...` lines
  that QUOTE instructions, so strip each line's first `#` to EOL before counting
  — `grep -v '^#'` misses them because they start with `nop`. And in a gte.h
  function `swc2 $17,...` is COP2 register 17, NOT `$s1`.
  (Editing gotcha: `sed 's/#.*//'` written literally inside a C block comment
  embeds a `*/` and silently truncates the comment.)

### The two fence idioms: what each one ACTUALLY does

Fences became this project's dominant lever, so know precisely what you are
buying. They are reconstruction scaffolding (see the fence-debt rule) — every one
must be re-challenged at exact promotion — but the mechanisms below are real.

**`do{}while(0)` gives THREE things, and you rarely want all three:**
1. **Ref weight.** flow.c does `reg_n_refs += loop_depth`, and the fence leaves
   real `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END`, so enclosing K refs one level deeper buys +K
   weighted refs at ZERO asm cost. Depth is a DIAL, not a boolean: a double fence
   (depth 3) buys +2/ref. This feeds BOTH `global.c`'s
   `floor_log2(refs)*refs/live_length` AND local-alloc's `QTY_CMP_PRI`
   (same weighted refs) — so it also re-ranks short-lived constants.
2. **A scheduling barrier.** In `sched_analyze_insn` a mid-block loop note is a
   full barrier (it must be, or `loop_depth` would be wrong): every following
   insn gains a dependency on all prior sets — i.e. **a fence PINS the emitted
   order of the statement it wraps.** The tell is a LOG_LINK with no data behind
   it. When a fenced statement sits where the target's does not, the fence is the
   suspect.
3. **A hard barrier to LOCAL-ALLOC's copy propagation.** `optimize_reg_copy_1`
   (local-alloc.c:753 — there is NO `regmove.c` in gcc 2.8.1) rewrites a later
   read of `src` into `dst` after a copy `dst = src`; its forward scan breaks on
   a `CODE_LABEL`, a `JUMP_INSN`, or a `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END`. So a fence that
   **ENCLOSES THE COPY** puts a loop note between the copy and the read and
   blocks the rewrite. The fence must CONTAIN the copy — one merely nearby does
   nothing.
4. **Nothing else — in particular NO basic-block boundary.** `find_basic_blocks`
   starts a block only at a `CODE_LABEL` or after a `JUMP_INSN`/`BARRIER`/
   `CALL_INSN`; loop notes only change `depth`. So a fence can never keep a copy
   alive past combine, and it does NOT block cse store-to-load forwarding.

**An identical-arm fence (`if (c) { A } else { A }`) gives the thing the other
cannot: a real CODE_LABEL / block boundary**, and costs nothing in the end
because `jump_optimize(insns, 1, 1, 0)` — the only call with `cross_jump=1`
(toplev.c:3548) — runs AFTER combine. Caveat: jump1 hoists a common leading insn
out of both arms, so put a dead store inside one arm to make the heads differ.
Its CONDITION is load-bearing.

**An EMPTY `do{}while(0)` is a PURE barrier — zero ref reweighting — which makes
it an ATTRIBUTION TEST.** It emits the same `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END` sched1
honours but encloses no refs (jump.c does not strip them). Run the ref-enclosing
fence and the empty fence at the same point: if both give an IDENTICAL byte
count, the barrier — not the ref weight — is doing all the work, and you are
looking at a scheduling problem, not an allocation one. (StageEndScreen: both
forms gave byte-identical 242, proving the entire +39 was barrier cost.)

**A "source-position-invariant" park note is a claim about source MOVES only.** A
barrier is a different lever and CAN break such a tie — test it before accepting
the verdict. On StageEndScreen it did break the sched1 hoist (`li s7,82` left
0x800536bc), but the sub-block re-scheduled for a net loss: the verdict survived
while its reasoning did not.

**Failure modes, all paid for in real bytes:**
- **Over-ballasting.** Too much depth pushes the wrong rival ahead. Compute BOTH
  rivals' priorities from `.lreg` first and pick the SMALLEST depth that wins the
  inequality. (AddEnemy's own `FENCE_10` on `category = 0` stole `$s2` from
  `think` — a 9-byte self-inflicted wound, fixed by dropping it to `FENCE_6`.)
- **Mis-siting.** A fence weights EVERY pseudo it encloses, so site it where your
  pseudo's refs OUTNUMBER the rival's — histogram both. Prefer the opposite
  branch of an if/else from the collateral pseudos.
- **Mis-bounding.** A value defined just outside and used inside gets reloaded
  (+1 insn): pull the defining statement in. A fence that looks inherently
  expensive is often mis-bounded by one line.
- **Inherent cost.** If tightening the footprint changes nothing, the cost IS the
  notes; stop tuning and remove the need for the fence.

- **Count the TARGET's mentions of a register before theorising about ref counts
  — it costs one grep.** If the target mentions a register N times, the original
  pseudo has N-2 body refs (the prologue `sw` and epilogue `lw` are the other
  two). A whole mission_score_screen round was justified by "the original's
  rankSpriteBase carries 8 weighted refs"; `grep -c '\$s7'` on the target shows
  exactly 4 mentions — 1 def + 1 use, the same raw shape as ours — and the story
  was dead in one command. Confirm a pseudo's identity by its DISPOSITION, then
  confirm its ref count against the TARGET's mentions, before building any
  argument on top.
- **A fence's cost can be INHERENT to the loop notes, not collateral.** Shrinking
  mission_score_screen's rank scaffold from the whole block to just the def
  (same weighted refs) recovered exactly ZERO bytes. If tightening a fence's
  footprint changes nothing, its ~30B is the notes themselves, and the answer is
  to stop needing the fence — not to tune it.
- **`do{}while(0)` fences raise LOCAL-alloc priority too, not just global.**
  `QTY_CMP_PRI = floor_log2(n_refs)*n_refs*size/(death-birth)*10000` uses the
  same loop-depth-weighted `n_refs` as `global.c`, so a fence inflates enclosed
  SHORT-LIVED CONSTANTS, allocating them earlier so they grab a lower hard reg
  (`find_free_reg` scans ascending; MIPS has no `REG_ALLOC_ORDER`). An
  unexplained caller-saved register shift near fenced code is usually this — not
  an independent local-alloc problem, and there is no separate local-alloc knob
  to reach for.
- **Siting a `do{}while(0)` ref-fence: histogram BOTH rivals, not just the pseudo
  you want to lift.** The fence weights EVERY pseudo whose refs it encloses, so a
  region that mentions the rival more makes the gap WORSE (a Z-block fence moved
  p80 74→88 but p81 104→128, taking the ask from +20 to +40). Prefer a region on
  the OPPOSITE BRANCH of an if/else from the collateral pseudos — it cannot touch
  them. FUN_80057b80's swap closed the moment the fence moved from the midpoint
  block (26 param_1 refs but where the midpoint pointers live, so it permuted
  s2–s7 every time) to the leaf vertex copies (12 vs 0 — the other branch), where
  every other disposition stayed put and the swap came free.
- **Cost a fence's BOUNDARY, not just its contents.** `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END` are
  scheduling barriers, so any value DEFINED just outside the fence and USED inside
  gets reloaded (+1 instruction). Pull the defining statement inside the fence. A
  fence that looks inherently expensive is often just mis-bounded by one line:
  FUN_80057b80's "+1 nop tax" was blamed on the register permutation for a whole
  round, but the leaf fence permutes nothing and still cost +1 — the real cause
  was `prim = param_2[5]` sitting one line outside the fence while all 12 uses
  sat inside. Moving the boundary restored the exact length.
- **Fence nesting depth is load-bearing.** `reg_n_refs` is `+= loop_depth`, so a
  DOUBLE `do{}while(0)` (depth 3) buys +2 per enclosed ref where a single buys
  +1 — a 12-ref region can suffice where one fence over the same region cannot.
- **A loop note does NOT block cse store-to-load forwarding.** Fencing a
  same-block read does not turn its `sll/sra` back into an `lh`; the fence is a
  scheduling barrier, not an aliasing one (FUN_80057b80 site B: +1 and no fold).
  A fence pays ONLY where it creates a barrier the target actually needs —
  fencing a read that already follows a join buys the rival refs and breaks the
  flip (494→574).
- **Keeping a redundant SImode copy alive (`move rX,rY` before a zero-test) — and
  why `do{}while(0)` CANNOT do it.** combine folds `t = v; if (t)` only when
  flow.c built a LOG_LINK, and `mark_set_1` builds one only when
  `BLOCK_NUM(use) == BLOCK_NUM(set)`; cse separately propagates the copy within
  one extended block. So the copy survives only with a real **CODE_LABEL**
  between it and its use. A `do{}while(0)` can never supply that boundary:
  `find_basic_blocks` starts a block only at a `CODE_LABEL` or after a
  `JUMP_INSN`/`BARRIER`/`CALL_INSN`, and **loop notes only adjust `depth`**.
  An identical-arm fence `if (c) { A } else { A }` DOES supply the label and
  costs nothing in the end, because `jump_optimize(insns, 1, 1, 0)` — the only
  call with `cross_jump=1` (toplev.c:3548) — runs AFTER combine. The catch:
  **jump1 hoists a common leading insn out of two identical arms** and destroys
  the boundary before flow runs, so put a dead store (`final = 0;`) INSIDE one
  arm to make the heads differ. Measured on ActivateHumans (its last 3 bytes):
  correct form → MATCH; drop the dead store or hoist it out of the arm → the
  copy vanishes; `c ? v : v` → also gone (fold-const collapses `a ? b : b`).
  The fence's CONDITION is load-bearing too (`if (human)` matched; `if (target)`
  cost 10 bytes).
  **This is the sharp line between the two fence idioms**: `do{}while(0)` gives
  loop-note ref WEIGHT and a scheduling barrier but no block boundary; an
  identical-arm fence gives a real block boundary. Pick by which one the
  mechanism needs.
- **`optimize_reg_copy_1` lives in `local-alloc.c` in this cc1 — there is no
  `regmove.c` in gcc 2.8.1.** If a copy `dst = src` is followed by a later read of
  `src`, local-alloc rewrites that read to `dst` — so a sign-extension can end up
  reading the copy's DESTINATION rather than its source, and cse/loop/combine/sched
  are all innocent (ActSTICKON's last byte: every earlier pass read the right
  register). The guard is `! find_reg_note (insn, REG_DEAD, SET_SRC (set))`, and
  the forward scan breaks on a `CODE_LABEL`, a `JUMP_INSN`, or a
  `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END`. To keep the target's read of `src`, place a
  `do{}while(0)` so that it ENCLOSES the copy.
- **The self-XOR (`x ^= x ^ y`) and an enclosing fence are INDEPENDENT levers and
  can both be required at one site**: the fence blocks the copy-propagation
  rewrite, the XOR stops the copy being coalesced away. (ActSTICKON: replacing the
  XOR with a plain `angle = next_angle` cost 4 bytes even WITH the fence.)
- **`sched` CANNOT reorder a LOAD-FREE block — so a misplaced instruction there
  is SOURCE ORDER, not a scheduling tie.** gcc-2.8.1's `sched.c:1521` computes
  `priority(x) + insn_cost(x,…) - 1`, and its own comment says it outright:
  *"When all instructions have a latency of 1 … all instructions will end up with
  a priority of one, and hence no scheduling will be done."* Only a LOAD (cost 2)
  differentiates. So in a block of pure ALU/store/branch insns, stop permuting
  and stop reading `.sched2` — fix the statement order. (Corollary: if the
  target's order is unreachable from ANY source order in such a block, that is a
  real park.) `-O2` does enable both schedulers and reorg (toplev.c:3798/3815).
- **You cannot park a statement between a compare and its branch.** Hoisting the
  compare into a `cond` local fails: combine merges it into the branch and
  `find_split_point` re-splits it AT the branch, relocating it back below your
  statement. The tell is that the compare's SHAPE changes too (`sra`/`slti` ->
  `lui`/`slt` against `2<<16`).
- **`bnez / nop / move dst,src / L: sh dst` is a SELECT with ONE store.**
  Reproduce it with `if (c) next = saved; X = next;` — NEVER a ternary, which
  makes cc1 duplicate the surrounding store into both arms (+8 on FUN_8005a7a4).
  **A two-store draft masquerades as a register-allocation difference**: the tell
  is that the store both sides agree on is already absent from the diff. Once the
  select was right there, `regalloc.py --compare` quantified the rest exactly
  (`needs +1 weighted ref`) and one fence around only the `next_state` read
  delivered it — six swapped instructions fell at once.
- **Before adding `D_XXXXXXXX = 0x…;` for an undefined reference, grep
  `config/symbols.main.exe.txt` for the ADDRESS** — it may already exist under
  its real name, and splat will reject the duplicate (`Duplicate symbol
  detected!`). A sibling lane's rename landing on master can break a parked
  draft's auto-label this way: the fix is to rename in the draft, not to re-add
  the symbol (FUN_8005a7a4 vs `CardStateFlag` at 0x80097D2C).
- **A register SWAP is only a PRIORITY question once you have checked the loser
  CAN HOLD the winner's register.** Read the allocno's CONFLICT LIST for the
  target hard reg BEFORE computing any priority or touching a fence depth — a
  flipped allocation order over a hard-reg conflict is a guaranteed no-op.
  Measured: AddEnemy's `category = 0` fence was dropped to FENCE_5, the
  allocation order flipped EXACTLY as the arithmetic predicted (`95 90 82` ->
  `95 82 90`), and **not one byte changed** — the `item` allocno carries hard
  regs 16 AND 17 in its conflict list and cannot hold `$s1` at any priority. No
  fence depth could ever have worked. This check is one line of `.greg` and it
  invalidates whole rounds of priority arithmetic.
- **A ballast site pays for EVERY register the statement mentions, not just the
  one you meant** — so choose it for three things at once: the refs it adds, every
  register it mentions, and its scheduling neighbourhood. Both failure modes are
  measured on AddEnemy: `FENCE_19` on `think_item = item` ballasts the
  destination too (creating a fresh `$a0`/`$a1` swap), and relocating that
  ballast to the pre-loop `item = ItemName` costs 16 bytes by disturbing an
  already-exact scheduled block.
- **Confirm a pseudo's IDENTITY via its DISPOSITION before believing any priority
  verdict about it.** `regalloc.py`'s priority list and its disposition list are
  separate, and an allocno with a priority but NO `pN->reg` disposition is a
  SPILLED pseudo — not the variable you are reasoning about.
  mission_score_screen carried "ten vs rankSpriteBase: 15x gap,
  priority-INFEASIBLE" through three rounds because the 99-priority allocno was
  read as rankSpriteBase when it was really the spilled `insertedRank`; the true
  competitor sat at 544 vs ten's 1375 (2.5x), and `--compare` reported "needs +4
  weighted refs". **A gap that names a variable you never confirmed is a misread,
  not a wall.**
- **`$s8` is `$30` — the LAST register `find_reg` scans.** MIPS defines no
  `REG_ALLOC_ORDER`, so cross-call allocnos take `$s0..$s7` then `$30`. If the
  target holds a HIGH-ref value in `$s8`, that value is allocated LAST and must
  therefore rank BELOW its neighbour — the opposite of the intuitive reading.
  (mission_score_screen chased this backwards for three rounds.)
- **`floor_log2` makes the ref payoff LUMPY — aim at the step.** Priority is
  `floor_log2(refs)*refs/live_length`, so refs 4→7 moved one allocno 544→952
  while 4→8 jumped it to 1632. Target the power-of-two boundary, not a linear
  increment. `regalloc.py --enclosed-refs` already models the loop weighting —
  use it instead of hand-arithmetic.
- **The ref lever is NEVER "exhausted" by asm-mention count: `reg_n_refs` is
  LOOP-DEPTH WEIGHTED, and a `do{}while(0)` buys weight for free.** flow.c adds
  one unit per enclosed ref per loop depth, and a `do{}while(0)` emits no code
  but DOES leave the `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG/END` notes flow.c weights by — so
  enclosing K refs one level deeper is exactly +K weighted refs at ZERO asm
  cost. (`regalloc.py --enclosed-refs` already models this.) Proven on
  FUN_80057b80: fencing param_1's refs took p80 74→94 weighted refs, priority
  3368→4279 > p81's 4244, producing the target's `p80→$s0 / p81→$s1` — verified
  at cc1 level and free inside the compiler (766 insns either way).
  **Costs**: it re-weights EVERY pseudo inside the fence, and a short live range
  gains more priority per ref than a long one, so close-scoring neighbours
  permute; on FUN_80057b80 all 8 fence regions flipped the swap but each cost
  +1 nop (a broken load-delay-slot fill) because param_1's refs are structurally
  interleaved with the midpoint pointers. So: reach for this on any
  priority-window park, but budget for the collateral.
  This also means an argument of the form "the target's asm only mentions X N
  times, so its priority cannot exceed P" is UNSOUND whenever the function has
  loops — refs are not mentions.
- **`.lreg` live_length is what `global_alloc` consumes — and `.greg` hands you a
  free oracle to prove it.** `.greg`'s `;; N regs to allocate:` line is printed
  in allocno_order, i.e. the real post-qsort order. Score a model against it:
  `.lreg`'s live_length gave 0 violations across 53 adjacent pairs, `.flow`'s
  gave 15. (`live_length` > instruction count is NOT a "pre-combine" tell — it
  is not a naive per-insn count. `.flow` IS the pre-combine dump and it is the
  one that fails.) Use this oracle before believing any claim that a regalloc
  model is reading the wrong dump.
- **Ghidra's reused variables are MEGA-PSEUDOS — split them per site.** This is
  the highest-yield structural check on any big function. Ghidra reuses one
  variable (`iVar3`, `uVar2`, …) for a dozen unrelated jobs. Each C local is ONE
  pseudo, and one pseudo gets ONE hard register for ALL its fragments — so a
  conflict in any single fragment exiles every use. Splitting `iVar3`'s ~12 jobs
  into per-site/per-block locals took FUN_80057b80 from 759 → 722 → 619 and made
  a0/a3/t0/s2–s7 match the target exactly.
  - **Diagnostic, do it FIRST on a big function**: `tools/reghist.py <Name>`
    histograms register mentions target-vs-draft. A caller-saved register the
    draft mentions ~70 times is a mega-pseudo — no real source has one (the
    target had 5). It is also a cheap EXHAUSTION proof: **read the delta SUM.**
    Zero-sum deltas confined to the argument registers are the signature of pure
    renames of identical instructions — the decomposition already matches and no
    splitting lever remains (StageEndScreen, AddEnemy). A non-zero sum means real
    structural divergence.
  - The proof that they are separate source variables is direct: the target
    assigns the *same expression* (`puVar4 = param_2[5]`) to **a1, a1, a1, a2**
    across four blocks. A single pseudo can only ever get one register.
  - **Corollary — a delay-slot or scheduling difference can be a pure CONSEQUENCE
    of allocation.** Four surplus `sra`-in-`bgez`-delay-slot sites vanished for
    free once the split landed: the target's value lives in `$v0`, where the
    filler would clobber its own input, so the slot must stay `nop`; ours lived in
    `$a3`, so reorg could speculate it in. Fix the allocation, not the schedule.
- **Narrow locals are genuine QI/HI pseudos here — not PROMOTE_MODE-promoted.**
  `rtldump` shows `reg/v:QI` / `reg/v:HI` directly, so a narrow local ALWAYS
  needs a real extension (`sll`/`andi`) and can never produce the target's bare
  `move`. If a target join copies with a plain `move`, that value is SImode in
  the original, whatever a narrow spelling does elsewhere (ActivateHumans).
- **A `.greg` "hard-conflict" can be an artifact of BIRTH ORDER, not of the
  values.** mission_score_screen's row draw carried a recorded
  "rowValue->a0 hard-conflict p91" through two passes; giving the row its own
  macro so `value` became the COPY (born second) instead of the `andi` owner
  (born first) dissolved it outright. Before accepting a conflict verdict, ask
  which of the two values is created first and whether the source can swap that.
- **The DamageControl escalation lessons (1320→0, fence-free)** — the three that
  closed the game's largest function:
  1. *An ASSIGNED `__builtin_abs` reaches mips `abssi2` — ONE type-`multi` insn*
     whose template carries its own branch (`bgez %1,1f%# / subu %0,$0,%0 / 1:`).
     It is byte-identical to open-coded `bgez/nop/negu` but **invisible to
     reorg**. Tell: the target shows `bgez x,+2 / nop / negu x,x` AND a nearby
     branch delay holds a `nop` while an eligible independent insn (e.g. a
     register copy in a load-delay slot) sits above it. The explicit
     `if (x<0) x=-x;` exposes a real `bgez` whose backward scan provably steals
     that copy — `reorg.c fill_simple_delay_slots` accumulates set/needed and
     takes the first non-conflicting insn, and NO fence topology stops it (the
     scan only stops at labels/jumps/SEQUENCEs). The multi-insn also removes a
     block boundary, which can re-derive the whole surrounding allocation with
     no fence at all.
  2. *A promoted-var re-type silently moves flow2 refs between an allocno and
     its extension temp*: `short = s8` (QI→HI, a real conversion) keeps def+use
     refs on the destination pseudo, while `short = u16` (HImode
     reinterpretation = a copy) lets cse rewrite the uses onto the extension
     temp and delete the def — −2 refs, enough to cross a `floor_log2` boundary
     and flip allocation order. Measure with `.flow`'s `Register N used M times`
     lines (`rtldump --pass all`) and `regalloc.py --between`.
  3. *A goto-shaped loop and a real `while` differ in NOTE_INSN_LOOP weighting
     even at identical bytes*: loop-body refs count DOUBLE in flow2. When a
     callee-saved role needs exactly +refs and has any use inside a Ghidra
     if+goto loop, restore the real loop form first — it is also the faithful
     source. (Contrast the goto-loop rule above, which is for suppressing
     loop.c hoisting: same construct, opposite lever, pick by what the target
     needs.)
- **The BreedLife escalation lessons (59→0, fence-free and volatile-free)**:
  1. *The dup-while head family*: a `%hi`-folded row-0 check plus a
     strength-reduced walker loop whose backedge lands ONE insn past the
     loop-top load is
     `while (Tbl[idx].f != SENT) { if (Tbl[idx].f == key) break; idx++; }` —
     the entry check is jump.c's exit-test duplication (`idx==0` cse-folded) and
     the backedge offset is reorg skipping the redundant target-head load. Never
     reconstruct it with walker/preload locals: `stmt.c expand_end_loop` rotates
     any do-while whose body leads with a conditional exit, and cse peels every
     hand-built preload.
  2. *An explicit guard duplicating a `while`'s entry condition is
     load-bearing*: it makes the machine-made duplicate fold
     (`record_jump_equiv` on the fall-through). Without it the surviving dup
     derails giv reduction (extra callee-saved, in-loop index recompute).
  3. *A loop-invariant assignment as the FIRST BODY statement* is hoisted by
     loop.c into the post-check preheader (in-place `addiu hi,hi,%lo`) — a
     position no pre-loop statement can reach. Sound when every use-path runs
     at least one iteration.
  4. *Stop fighting cse on repeated global loads in one ebb*: the second load
     folds to the first's value (even via the s16 two-step — cse records narrow
     equivalents), and `find_best_addr` rewrites register addresses to `%lo`
     forms wherever a symbol equivalence exists. `volatile` blocks the fold but
     splits HImode loads into `lhu+sll+sra`. Two target loads ⇒ the second sits
     behind a label or is compiler-made (dup/giv) — find that structure.
  5. *`q = pp` survives as a real copy iff its uses sit behind a loop label*
     (`optimize_reg_copy_1` cannot cross one); pp dying at the copy is what lets
     pp share the index's register.
- **Independent recompute vs. copy defeats coalescing.** When the target keeps
  two same-valued pointers in SEPARATE homes (one in a register, one spilled),
  do NOT write `b = a;` — a register-to-register copy carries a preference edge
  that makes cc1 coalesce them into one register, losing the spill. Compute both
  independently from the same base (`a = p + K; b = p + K;`): CSE folds the
  arithmetic to one `addiu`, but the independent defs carry no preference edge,
  so the allocator can spill one and keep the other. (`volatile` also forces the
  spill but over-constrains scheduling — 181 hunks vs 149 on FUN_80057b80.)
- **Store through the derived pointer, not base + offset.** If the target
  computes a sub-object pointer (`addiu $s6,$s0,0x10`) and then stores through
  it (`sh $v0,0x2($s6)`), the source wrote those fields THROUGH that pointer.
  Writing them as `base + offset` makes cc1 use the base for everything,
  starving the derived pointer of references so it scores below other values and
  steals their register. The first store of each block keeps the base
  (`sh $v0,0x10($s0)`); every subsequent field goes through the pointer. This is
  the concrete, reachable mechanism behind a parked note like "requires all
  midpoint pointers scored above X" — not a sub-C tie.
- **On a length-mismatched draft, autorules' score is the LENGTH PENALTY ALONE
  (`1000 + |delta|`) — review every adoption before believing it.** Any edit
  that shortens the function toward the target scores better, including one that
  shortens it by DELETING instructions the target has in a region that already
  matched. ChasetoTarget adopted `deg: short→s32` this way (1012→1008): it
  removed the target's own `sll/sra` sign-extension pair, and PSX.SYM
  independently recorded `deg` as a `short`. This is the same class as
  AddEnemy's `s16→s8` narrow (wrong shift width, and it masked a −14 win).
  autorules now prints `LENGTH-WIN SHAPE REGRESSION` when a length win costs
  aligned lines, but the judgment is yours: a type-width edit that changes or
  deletes a target-present sign-extension is wrong however it scores.
- **An abs must reach `ABS_EXPR` — but HOW you spell it there does not matter.**
  `x >= 0 ? x : -x`, `__builtin_abs(x)`, and an assigned `t = __builtin_abs(x)`
  are all IDENTICAL to cc1 2.8.1: `fold-const.c` ("If we have A op 0 ? A : -A")
  rewrites the conditional into `ABS_EXPR` before expand, and all three then
  reach the `mips.md` `abssi2` pattern. What LOSES is the open-coded
  `t = x; if (x < 0) t = -x;`, which fold cannot see and which never becomes
  `abssi2`: it (a) schedules its copy early into a free caller-saved register
  and (b) adds a ref to `x` that flips the `.greg` priority so `x`'s sibling
  loses its callee-saved home (`t = -t` does NOT fix (b) — cse
  copy-propagates it back to `t = -x`). ChasetoTarget's win was reaching
  `ABS_EXPR` at all; an earlier version of this rule credited "inline vs named
  temp" and was **disproven by direct experiment** (all three spellings emit
  byte-identical asm) — do not propagate that framing.
- **Inline a CSE'd pointer-array element into the expression that first uses
  it, so it loads late and reuses a dying pointer's register.** A named
- **Inline a CSE'd pointer-array element into the expression that first uses
  it, so it loads late and reuses a dying pointer's register.** A named
  `c1 = chase[1]` temp schedules early (before the target pointer's register
  dies) and can't reuse it; inlining `chase[1]` into the consuming expression
  loads it after the pointer frees its register (ChasetoTarget: reused `$a1`
  exactly like retail — while its sibling `c0` stayed a named temp because
  the target loads it separately).
- **The LoadConstruction escalation lessons (643→0, fence-free)** — six rules
  from the pass that dissolved two recorded "unreachable" verdicts:
  1. *Rotating t0–t3 reloads mean plain SPILLED LOCALS, not an addressable
     struct.* Target reloading stack scalars into rotating t-regs at use
     sites, homing params at the arg slot early, parking spill stores in
     delay slots, and narrowing a field-store reload to `lhu` = locals whose
     pseudos lost allocation. Spill slots are assigned in pseudo-number order
     = DECLARATION order (function scope first, later blocks after), so the
     target's slot order dictates the declaration order. The
     addressable-struct+volatile reconstruction instead gives v0/a0/v1 homes
     and frozen scheduling (~300 of the 643 bytes).
  2. *gcc 2.8.1 rounds each BLKmode local's stack slot up to 8 bytes.* Odd
     20-byte aggregates spaced 24 apart are N separate locals, not a packed
     struct with pads; a wrapper struct rounds only its total and shifts
     every later slot.
  3. *Div-and-mask single-def idiom:* target `andi $sN,v0,7` as the ONLY def
     of a callee-saved home = `long a, q; if (a >= 0) q = a/16000; else
     q = a/16000 - 1; x = q & 7;`. The anonymous ternary ties the dividend
     into v1; the NAMED q keeps it in a0 with untied sign temps, and the
     single def drops the home's priority, un-packing coalesced families.
  4. *Offset-then-base split steers tree shape AND the allocno ladder:*
     `p = (T)((z<<2)+((x<<8)+(y<<5))); p = (T)((int)p + (int)Base);` puts the
     partial sum in the carrier's own register and the +2 refs lift the
     carrier above a loop giv — where the one-expression form leaves a temp.
  5. *Param-indexed counting loop:* base reloading from the param home slot,
     advance in the backedge delay slot, hoisted comparison constant BEFORE
     the base load, nop at loop top = direct `((T *)param)[i]` indexing
     strength-reduced by loop.c; a hand walker variable reverses the
     preheader order.
  6. *Engineer the allocation ladder with regalloc.py, ±1–2 refs at a time.*
     find_reg is an ascending scan with sharing (an allocno takes the lowest
     hard reg with no conflicting resident), so allocation ORDER is the whole
     game; the printed priority `floor_log2(refs)*refs/live*10000` is exact
     integer math. Steer with statement splits — preferred over fences; every
     fence in this function was eventually replaced and the match is
     fence-free.
- **A folded pointer-address constant vs the symbol form is a COUPLED trade,
  not a free fix.** An address whose low 16 bits are ≥0x8000 materializes as
  `lui HI; ori LO` from a constant, but `lui HI+1; addiu LO-0x10000` from a
  symbol. When the target shows the symbol/addiu form but switching to the
  symbol extends a `%hi` live range that defeats a downstream register-reuse
  coalesce, the constant form is the local optimum: right register, a few
  wrong immediate bytes (StageEndScreen's terminal `&D_8008EA78`: 8 bytes
  wrong vs a 33-byte cascade). Check the cascade before "fixing" the addiu.
- **PARK ON SIGHT — the preheader priority-1 LUID tie.** Two loop-invariant
  callee-saved constant loads (e.g. a division reciprocal magic and a
  coordinate constant) contending for the same preheader slot region, both
  `priority = 1, ref_count = 0` in `.sched`, are tie-broken by pre-scheduling
  LUID. A CSE/LICM-hoisted magic's LUID is pinned at the preheader dominator
  and cannot be pushed below a source-level constant assignment, so no
  statement reordering flips it — and a one-instruction shift over a long
  block can dominate the whole byte count (~140 of StageEndScreen's 203).
- **The `do{}while(0)` wall generalizes from a single statement to a whole
  `if`-block**: `do { if (cond) { ... } } while (0)` walls off a copy the local
  allocator would propagate through the block, changing register homes with
  zero emitted code (AddEnemy's think-scan guard, −4).
- **`Array[count]` (ARRAY_REF, base-first) vs `ptr[count]` (pointer deref,
  index-first) helps ONLY where the base is freshly materialized at that
  site.** When a pointer alias is already cached in a callee-saved register
  across the region, the array form recomputes the base and REGRESSES
  (AddEnemy: fresh `sp+0x590` base → −4; cached `s0` base → +2). Pick the form
  from the target's addu order at each site, not globally.
- **The `acc = acc | call()` OR-temp copy-move is FORCEABLE — by narrowing the
  ACCUMULATOR, not by respelling the copy.** (This rule previously said PARK ON
  SIGHT; that was wrong and is retracted.) The target keeps the accumulator live
  via `or $tmp,$acc,$ret; move $acc,$tmp` so a later `(short)acc` narrows the
  temp. No spelling of the copy survives — `optimize_reg_copy_1` propagates and
  coalesces it (five spellings + a bounded permuter all failed). The lever is the
  accumulator's TYPE: make it a HImode `s16` (which is what PSX.SYM recorded —
  `reg $s2 short think`), and the compare then sign-extends from `$v0`, the OR
  result, instead of from the accumulator. That keeps the copy's SOURCE live past
  the copy, so `optimize_reg_copy_1` declines to fold it and the `move` survives
  (AddEnemy, 125→81). **The general lesson: when a park note says "only a
  different data flow would fix this", that sentence is the lead — a data-flow
  change usually means a TYPE or lifetime change, not another spelling.**
- **Do NOT fuse two locals to chase a demo symbol's register — that MAKES the
  conflict.** An earlier AddEnemy pass fused `names_offset` and `type` into one
  local because PSX.SYM showed both in `$s7`. The fused local had three reaching
  defs (`=0`, `+=20`, `=(s16)AdtSelect(...)`), which blocked
  `num_sign_bit_copies` and forced a call-arg narrow. Split apart, the allocator
  puts both in `$s7` anyway — their ranges are disjoint. This is the mega-pseudo
  rule in reverse: the demo's shared register is a RESULT of the original's
  lifetimes, not an instruction to share a variable.
- **combine's `num_sign_bit_copies` elides a redundant call-arg narrow only
  for a SINGLE-assignment `(s16)`-cast local.** A variable reused across two
  roles (a loop-phase `addiu` offset + a selected value) carries the
  `addiu`'s low sign-bit-copies and forces the `sll/sra`; split into two
  disjoint-lifetime locals to restore the elision — but the split can drop an
  instruction that must be rebalanced elsewhere.
- **Write an s16→s32 sign-extend as an explicit in-place shift pair on the
  destination** (`x <<= 16; x >>= 16;`, or `x = src << 16; x >>= 16;`) to force
  `sll d,d,16; sra d,d,16` IN PLACE instead of routing the intermediate through
  a `$v0` scratch — a matching lever for `x = (s16)x` / `x = (s16)src` sites
  (FUN_800519bc, two position sign-extends). Candidate for a future autorules
  rule (backlog).
- **A guard comparison's operand order is a branch-encoding lever even when it
  does NOT fix the register tie it was aimed at.** Spelling
  `if (StagePlayer != Me_MOTION_C)` instead of `Me_MOTION_C != StagePlayer`
  realigned branch operand encodings across the enclosing drift region for −6
  bytes in DamageControl, *without* moving the StagePlayer temp off its
  (still-wrong) $v0 home. In a same-length drift region, try both operand
  orders of a guard as a bounded probe — a net byte win can come from encoding
  alignment alone. (`autorules --guided`'s `cmp-swap` currently misses these:
  its site selection targets combine/expression-owned hunks, not
  regalloc-owned guard hunks — extending it is on the tooling backlog.)
- **do{}while(0) fences are reconstruction scaffolding, not original idiom —
  treat them as debt.** They reproduce LOOP_BEG/LOOP_END RTL effects
  (scheduling barrier; allocation weight when non-empty) that the original
  source got from its real shapes. The byte gate legitimizes them, but every
  fence is an admission that the faithful spelling wasn't found. REQUIRED at
  exact-promotion time: challenge each remaining fence (autorules
  `empty-loop-boundary` removal + `fence-unwrap` enumerate exactly these) and
  keep only the ones whose removal breaks MATCH — those are load-bearing and
  document a real RTL boundary. **A fence's byte effect can be NON-LOCAL**: a
  fence wrapping an early prologue-region init (`do{sequence=0;}while(0)`)
  blocks sched2 from interleaving the callee-saved spills with the init
  writes, so its bytes surface ~100 lines away in the prologue
  (FUN_800519bc: removal closed 25 bytes far from the fence). This is why
  `fence-unwrap` sits in the DEFAULT autorules rule set, ungated by guided
  line-adjacency — challenge ALL fences, not just residual-adjacent ones.
- **A large exact-length block that appears ROTATED by one instruction —
  typically a call-argument copy sitting at the wrong END of the block — is
  often pinned by an equivalence fence (`do{}while(0)`) splitting the block.**
  The target schedules the independent arg copy early; the fence blocks cc1
  from floating it there. Remove a non-load-bearing fence and the arg copy
  floats toward the target position, collapsing the whole rotation. Verify by
  byte count; the copy floats up only to the next *required* scheduling
  barrier (e.g. a brightness/CSE fence), so a partial float can be the true
  ceiling. (mission_score_screen: an ~80-byte block-rotation hunk collapsed to
  a 9-instruction shift, 525→498.) `autorules` now enumerates this
  mechanically as `fence-unwrap` (every non-empty one-shot fence), and
  `asmdiff` prints each displayed hunk's insn/byte weight so a 20-instruction
  rotation is no longer indistinguishable from a 4-byte shift.
- **A whole SDK library can be epilogue-shape unmatchable: check `jr ra`'s
  delay slot before spending anything on an SDK cluster.** cc1-281's
  `mips_expand_epilogue` ALWAYS reorgs a trivial frame's sp-restore into the
  `jr ra` delay slot. The LIBCD/LIBPAD/LIBMCRD forwarding wrappers (the
  CdFlush/CdSetDebug/ResetCallback coddog clusters, 24 functions) were built
  by a different compiler that leaves `addiu sp,sp,N` BEFORE `jr ra` with a
  bare `nop` in the slot — every member is a permanent 6-of-32-byte
  NON_MATCHING under our pinned toolchain (drafts preserved on branch
  `codex/sdk-wave2-epilogue-blocked`). Libraries differ per game: LIBGS's
  `dmyGs*` stubs (sp-restore IN the slot) matched exactly. The tell costs one
  objdump line; read it first.
- **maspsx's `break` wants the single-value form `break 0x107`, not the
  two-operand disassembly `break 0, 263`.** maspsx (`elif op == "break"`) takes
  one immediate and splits it into the two 10-bit fields itself; the
  Ghidra/objdump-printed `break code1, code2` form crashes it with `invalid
  literal for int() with base 0: '0,'`. Relevant only when hand-writing inline
  asm for a raw BIOS trap (PClseek's `break 0x107` host-lseek — a syscall with
  no C representation. The adopted GTE policy (docs/gte-policy.md) deliberately
  EXCLUDES PClseek and the GetPad sign-extension trio: their originals were
  plain C or a libsn assembly object, so an asm body would be unfaithful; they
  stay parked NON_MATCHING; see GetPad.c).
- **An UNDER-SIZED `functions.tsv` entry carves a truncated function that still
  builds GREEN — the failure is silent.** `reverse.py` takes the function's size
  from the Ghidra export. If Ghidra sized it short, splat carves only the first
  N bytes; the tail is emitted as a `.data` blob (`asm/data/<off>.data.s`) which
  *defines the `.L` labels the carved asm jumps into*, so it links, and
  `./Build check` stays byte-identical. Nothing complains — you simply can never
  write C that byte-matches, because the real body is longer than the carve.
  Run **`tools/coverage.py`** before trusting a size; it finds code claimed by no
  function and names the culprit. Two exist in game code: `LoadCard`
  (0x114 → true 0x168) and `FUN_800593a0` (0x12C → true 0x27C). Carve those with
  `reverse.py <Name> --size 0x<true>` (verified green), and fix them in Ghidra.
  - **Variant: the missing tail can land in a plain anonymous
    `{ start: 0x…, type: data }` splat entry sandwiched between two real
    functions** — no phantom label, no rename, just delete the entry. Same tell
    (a bare `jr ra` with no delay slot ending the preceding function's `.s`).
    Third confirmed instance: `valloc`, carved 456 bytes where the truth is 460
    (0x1CC); the stolen word at file `0x5F34` decodes to `addiu sp,sp,0x438`,
    sitting in `jr ra`'s delay slot. Note Ghidra's own `functions.tsv` was
    under-sized too, so `coverage.py` is the check, not the export.
    Fourth: `BreedLife` (0x8002a018), carved 628 where the truth is 632 — the
    return-delay-slot `addiu sp,sp,0xA8` was orphaned as a `.text`-ordered data
    blob at 0x19A8C between it and GetWeaponData (fixed; the carve is honest
    now).
  - **Meta-rule — when a parked NON_MATCHING draft carries padding/counterweight
    hacks to reach its length, first verify the carve is not under-sized.**
    objdump the word at `carve_start + carve_size`: if it is a `jr ra` delay
    slot or `addiu sp,sp,+N` frame teardown (not the next function's
    `addiu sp,sp,-N` prologue), the carve dropped the delay slot. Fixing the
    carve can make the hacks removable and unlock the real structure —
    BreedLife fell 214→59 differing bytes this way, and its entire type-range
    tail became byte-identical.
  - Tool gap (backlog): `reverse.py --size` cannot RE-carve an existing `c`
    subsegment (it prints "already a `c` subsegment" and returns); until it
    can absorb a trailing orphan blob, the mechanical fix is deleting the
    orphan `{ start, type: data }` yaml line, exactly like the valloc variant.

  - **Variant: the missing tail can land inside a NEIGHBOURING phantom function
    instead of an orphan `.data` blob, if Ghidra also independently placed a
    (bogus) function label exactly at the boundary.** Symptom: a trivial
    `void f(void)`-shaped target's FIRST instruction is a small **positive**
    `addiu sp,sp,+N` (not the usual negative frame-open) that doesn't fold into
    anything sensible no matter how you shape the source. Check the PRECEDING
    function's own carve: if it ends in a bare `jr ra` with no trailing
    delay-slot instruction at all (`endlabel` right after `jr ra` in its `.s`),
    that missing delay slot IS your function's leading `+N` — our cc1's
    `mips_expand_epilogue` ALWAYS reorgs the sp-restore into `jr ra`'s own
    delay slot (verified: no source shape leaves it bare), so the preceding
    function's TRUE carve is one word (4 bytes) longer than its
    `functions.tsv`/splat entry, and yours starts 4 bytes later than currently
    split. Corroborate before touching the boundary: `tools/xref.py <Name>`
    should show zero `jal` callers, and a raw byte-grep of the function's own
    address as a little-endian word across `disks/tenchu/main.exe` should find
    zero hits (no real function pointer/table targets it) — if both hold, it's
    a phantom Ghidra label, not a genuine callable entry. Fix: move the
    boundary 4 bytes later in `config/splat.main.exe.yaml` (shrinking the
    phantom entry, growing the preceding one by the same 4 bytes) and rename
    the file/function to match its TRUE start address (FUN_8005fe34, 84 bytes,
    was really AdtVsprintf's own missing epilogue word + FUN_8005fe38, 80
    bytes — both now match).
- **`config/symbols.main.exe.txt` (an ld/splat script) has NO comment syntax**
  — `//` or `/* */` is a hard parse error, not a no-op. If a splat-auto-named
  `D_XXXXXXXX` data symbol resolves to the wrong address (verify against the
  `.map`; a few bytes low, shared with a neighbor, = a pre-existing drift, not
  yours), bind a FRESH non-colliding name at the correct address there — it
  resolves regardless of the drifted file's byte-accumulation.
  - **A Ghidra `__override__prt_` symbol splits an ordinary function into two
    `.s` pieces — it is NOT a jump table.** Those symbols are Ghidra call-SITE
    prototype overrides (e.g. the `jal sprintf` inside `PathFileRead`), but splat
    reads `symbols.main.exe.txt` as `symbol_addrs` and starts a new piece at every
    symbol inside a function's range. A stub carrying only piece 1 fails to link
    (`undefined reference to .L<addr>` — a branch target living in piece 2), which
    reads like a bad carve boundary but isn't. `reverse.py` now detects this
    (every extra piece's symbol contains `__override__prt_`), seeds all pieces,
    and reports green; a real jump table still routes to `split-scaffold.py`.
    30 unmatched game functions still carry an interior marker (`valloc`,
    `Camera` ×3, `StageSequence` ×4, `LoadConstruction` ×3, …). FileOption's
    pure-C promotion removed the old 18-piece-stub blocker; dropping these
    non-symbols from `symbols.main.exe.txt` can now be evaluated as a separate
    repository cleanup.
  - **Matching a function can DELETE the very `D_` symbol its C body needs.**
    splat only auto-labels a data address that some still-carved *asm* refers to.
    The moment you replace the last such function with C, the `glabel`/auto-symbol
    disappears and the link fails with `undefined reference to D_XXXXXXXX` —
    which looks like your C is wrong, but is really the reference count hitting
    zero. Fix: add a plain `D_XXXXXXXX = 0xXXXXXXXX;` line to
    `config/symbols.main.exe.txt` (PathFileRead's `"%s%s"` at `D_800976DC`;
    contrast `D_800127A4`, which keeps its label only because AddMisc's
    jump-table asm still references it).
    - **Worse variant: it doesn't always fail loudly — it can silently resolve
      to the WRONG address instead, even past your own same-name rebinding.**
      If TWO already-matched `.c` files both plain-`extern` the same `D_`
      symbol with no explicit binding (each relying on splat's auto-name from
      whichever raw asm still referenced it), converting the LAST asm
      reference to C removes that anchor — but `undefined_symbols_auto.main.exe.txt`
      (a **generated meta linker script**, listed with `-T` *after*
      `config/symbols.main.exe.txt`) can still auto-derive an address for that
      same symbol NAME from an unrelated, drifted accumulation elsewhere, and
      GNU ld's plain `SYM = ADDR;` assignment takes the LAST script's value —
      so adding `D_XXXXXXXX = 0x<real>;` to `config/symbols.main.exe.txt`
      yourself does **not** win; the auto meta file processed after it
      silently overrides it back to the wrong address, and BOTH consumer
      files break together with no link error (`./Build check`'s hash just
      fails). Diagnose via the `.map`: `grep D_XXXXXXXX .shake/build/tenchu/main.exe.map`
      shows the address actually in effect. Fix (same recipe as the sibling
      bullet above, one level firmer): bind a **FRESH, non-colliding name**
      (not the old `D_` one) at the correct address, and update **every**
      already-matched consumer file's `extern` to the new name, not just the
      one you're currently drafting (FUN_80056e30 and DeleteCard.c both
      `extern`'d `D_80097D04`/`D_80097D08`; rebound as `CardVolumeIdPtr`/
      `CardPathFormat` in both files at once).
    - **The same fix applies to a string/constant that NO carved asm ever
      referenced, from a shared TU-wide rodata pool a sibling function
      already carved.** MISC.C's functions share ONE rodata block (splat
      auto-named `D_800127A4`/`D_800127BC` from it, both still-referenced by
      AddMisc's case-5 table); "unknown sprite type" — ProcMiscSprite's own
      error string, living in that SAME block a few bytes earlier — was
      NEVER referenced by any carved asm at all (ProcMiscSprite was still an
      `INCLUDE_ASM` stub), so splat never named it. Writing a fresh C string
      literal there places it in THIS file's own compiled rodata at the
      WRONG address (a different `.rodata` page entirely — not a small
      offset drift, verified 8+ pages off); the fix is the same
      `D_XXXXXXXX = 0xADDR;` binding (address confirmed by reading the raw
      ROM bytes at the offset), then `extern char D_XXXXXXXX[];` +
      `AdtMessageBox(D_XXXXXXXX)` instead of a literal. Tell: a Ghidra/m2c
      string-literal argument whose TU already has OTHER proven shared
      strings at nearby addresses (check the sibling's header comment).
  - **gp-output SVECTOR/aggregate whose fields splat auto-named as separate
    drifted `D_` symbols**: when a function writes a small SVECTOR to gp memory,
    splat names each *referenced field address* its own `D_XXXX` glabel and can
    place them at drifted addresses — so storing through the `D_` names puts
    every `sh`/`sw` at the wrong gp_rel offset. Bind ONE fresh correct-address
    name in `config/symbols` and declare it as the real SVECTOR; maspsx
    gp-addresses the `+2`/`+4` field offsets from that base fine (the original
    compiled it exactly that way, which is *why* splat saw separate addresses).
    Concrete: `ConflictDistance`/`ConflictModel` in GetConflictResult.
- `-fdollars-in-identifiers` is required for anything including
  `reference/ghidra_types.h` (Ghidra `$`-names); the mod pipeline passes it.
- The canonical cc1 correctly reads the **low** halfword for
  `(short) = (int)` truncation; if you see a high-half `lhu` (offset+2),
  something reintroduced the old non-canonical binary.
